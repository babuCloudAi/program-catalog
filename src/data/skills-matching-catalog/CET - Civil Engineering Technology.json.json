        "Description": "This course introduces students to computer aided drafting, where methods are taught with a major emphasis on practical application using two-dimensional AutoCAD software in the computer lab.  This includes the basic principles of civil engineering drawings to include but not limited to: dimensioning, spot elevations, contours, plan and profile view, section views, details, scaling, measurements.  It will introduce students to site plan drawings, structural views, architectural views, as well as buried infrastructure plan and profiles.  Finally, it will be the basis for preparation of a working set of plans, for use in all follow-on CET courses.",
