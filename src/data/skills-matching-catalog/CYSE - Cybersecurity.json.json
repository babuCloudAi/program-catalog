It delves into how risks, threats, and vulnerabilities influence information systems. Key areas of study include determining and managing acceptable risk levels for these systems. Participants will gain insights into components such as a business impact analysis (BIA), business continuity plan (BCP), disaster recovery plan (DRP), and the structure of a computer incident response team (CIRT) plan. The course also emphasizes compliance laws, standards, best practices, and methods for effective risk assessments.",
