The course will first provide a broad look at international politics through a review of select international incidents, military interventions, and homeland security issues. Second, select topics from these categories will serve as case studies to facilitate representing those events with the application of modeling, simulation, and visualization. Understanding how modeling and simulation can provide another method of analysis allows students to delve deeper into their understanding of \"what happened\" and to explore their conception of \"what if.\"",
