Students will practice these skills by giving presentations, enriching self-awareness with group discussions on prejudice, racism, values and customs, and participation in guided cultural encounters (such as field trip assignments that demand new behaviors). Students will participate in role-playing and in simulations of real-life demands in extended experimental encounters with another culture or complex approximations of another culture.
