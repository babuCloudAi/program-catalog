McKinney, PhD, RDH, Graduate Program Director</p>\n<p>The challenge of effecting change in the scope and direction of dental hygiene and health care requires&nbsp;competencies in collaborative&nbsp;problem solving, evidence-based ethical decision making, and leadership.</p>\n<p>Recipients of the Master of Science degree in dental hygiene develop skills to meet complex national and global health challenges in interprofessional education, knowledge-generation, information transfer, and health care for all members of society. Within a multidisciplinary, multicultural curricular framework that integrates theory, research, and practical experience, the competency-based program links goals and career aspirations of the student with relevant learning experiences, technologies, and resources to facilitate career advancement. Through specialized skills training, graduates are prepared to assume leadership roles necessary for quality professional dental hygiene care and advancing knowledge and practice.</p>\n<p>Solutions to complex health problems need the participation of dental hygienists educated in community health, research, management, education, public policy, and advocacy, just to name a few. Therefore, the program offers distinct specialty areas in which students may specialize: education, administration/management, research, marketing, community health, global health and modeling and simulation. Although graduate education focuses on developing a specialty, such specialization is viewed as secondary to generating evidence-based knowledge and theory through research. Demand for master’s level dental hygienists in these key areas of specialization continues to be strong and students are able to develop competencies essential in today’s employment market.</p>\n<p>Applicants are encouraged to contact the graduate program director to obtain additional information regarding requirements, experiential credit, cognate offerings, travel abroad, practica and externship opportunities. The program is available on campus, online, or as a hybrid of the two. Up to 12 approved graduate credit hours may be taken at another university and applied toward degree requirements, making this program one of the most flexible in the nation. The student-focused, nationally and internationally recognized faculty are committed to the educational preparation of dental hygienists leading to degrees at advanced levels; and the opportunity to segue to doctoral education in health services research within the College of Health Sciences.&nbsp;<em>This program is available on-campus and online</em>.</p>",

A primary research focus relates to neuromechanical basis of human movement under healthy and pathological conditions, with more clinically oriented studies on methods to improve gait and function in people with neurologic impairments. Lab Director, Dr. Steven Morrison, is a leading researcher in identifying risks for falling and testing interventions to prevent falls. This research laboratory is designed for multidisciplinary use by faculty and graduate students in Athletic Training, Physical Therapy, Human Movement Sciences, and Electrical and Computer Engineering. Collaboration among disciplines and with the Virginia Modeling and Simulation Center (VMASC) allows us to participate in exciting research projects exploring new technology in rehabilitation.</p>\n<h2>ODU Monarch Physical Therapy</h2>\n<p>The School of Rehabilitation Sciences, with support from the College of Health Sciences and Old Dominion University, operates a physical therapy clinic on the ODU campus.
