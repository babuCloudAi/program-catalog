Rao Chaganty, Statistics Program Director</p>\n<h2>Graduate Study in Computational and Applied Mathematics</h2>\n<p>The master’s and doctoral programs in computational and applied mathematics offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics are designed to produce applied mathematicians and statisticians who can meet the growing demand for analytical and computational skills in traditional scientific and multi-disciplinary fields. Students in the program can choose to pursue an option in either applied mathematics, mathematics of data science, statistics, or biostatistics.</p>\n<p>Applied mathematics is the application of mathematics to the solution of non-mathematical problems. Such problems may originate in math-oriented fields (physics, chemistry, and engineering) as well as in such areas such as geology, oceanography, meteorology, biology, ecology, environmental health, economics, actuarial science, business (operations and market research), banking, and medicine. Students will learn to use methods of applied mathematics, machine learning, data analysis, probability, statistics, biostatistics, numerical analysis, and scientific computing in seeking solutions to such problems. For work in computational and applied mathematics, training in an additional field of application is a necessity.</p>\n<p>The desire and ability to use mathematics to bring together various disciplines is the unique characteristic of an applied mathematician. Not only has mathematical modeling and solving of societal and scientific problems increased the demand for applied mathematicians, but the flexibility and breadth of knowledge inherent in this discipline make it attractive for those who do not want to become irreversibly specialized.</p>\n<p>Old Dominion University is one of the few American institutions offering a program expressly in applied mathematics. There are approximately 26 graduate program faculty members in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and current enrollment in the program is about 50 students. Areas of faculty research include analytical and numerical modeling in oceanography and meteorology, computational fluid dynamics and stability theory, elasticity and fracture mechanics, combustion theory, magnetohydrodynamics, mathematical biology, numerical analysis and approximation, optimization, applied probability, statistical inference, reliability, multivariate statistics, generalized linear models, estimating equations, biostatistics, nonparametric statistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, data science and high performance computing.</p>\n<p>Facilities within the metropolitan area include the NASA/Langley Research Center, the Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center (VMASC), and the Eastern Virginia Medical School.</p>\n<p>Program Financial Aid. The Department of Mathematics and Statistics offer graduate assistantships with stipends awarded to students after a competitive review process.&nbsp; The level of award is determined on the basis of previous experience and performance as a graduate assistant and on the student’s academic achievement and potential in applied mathematics or statistics. In addition, a number of teaching and research positions are available for financial support of graduate assistants during the summer months (June and July).</p>\n<p>Writing Proficiency. All students in the graduate program are expected to demonstrate an acceptable level of writing ability. Students needing help to remedy their writing deficiencies will be referred to the Writing Center for diagnosis and assistance.

It is critical that we understand both natural and human-induced processes that change this system so we are prepared to meet present and future challenges&nbsp;to our society. With curiosity, creativity, scholarship, and respect as cornerstones of our philosophy, we strive to increase scientific knowledge and literacy through excellence in research, education, and service to the Commonwealth of Virginia and society in general.</p>\n<h2>General Description of Graduate Degrees</h2>\n<p>Two graduate programs are offered:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Master of Science, Ocean and Earth Sciences</li>\n\t<li>Doctor of Philosophy, Oceanography</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Master of Science degree has both thesis and non-thesis options. The Ph.D. degree follows the traditional path of original research in the field of oceanography. For both degree paths, areas of emphasis are biological, chemical, geological, and physical oceanography, and the earth and geological sciences. Interdisciplinary studies are emphasized and an integral part of the student experience.&nbsp;The curricula are designed to prepare graduates for professional practice in their area of interest. Official transcripts, 3 letters of recommendation, TOEFL scores (international students), and a statement of goals and interest for graduate study should all be submitted to the Office of Admissions by January 1 for full consideration.</p>\n<p>The department receives support from the Commonwealth and local philanthropic sources, as well as from private industry, and considerable support from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation. &nbsp;Establishment of the Virginia Graduate Marine Science consortium by the General Assembly in 1979 demonstrated the Commonwealth’s determination to achieve excellence in marine science. The purpose of the consortium is to advance marine science instruction, research, training, and advisory services and to enhance Virginia’s position in seeking funding to carry out these activities. Charter members of the consortium ­are Old Dominion University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and the College of William and Mary. The Samuel L. and Fay M. Slover endowment to Old Dominion University in 1986 significantly accelerated the program of oceanographic studies. In 1991, a Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography (CCPO) was established at Old Dominion University by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The center is a Designated Center for Excellence.</p>\n<p>The Department of Ocean and Earth Sciences is housed in two buildings. The Oceanography/Physical Sciences Building contains state-of-the-art teaching laboratories, computer facilities, and research laboratories for geological sciences and biological, chemical and geological oceanography. The Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography is located in ODU’s Innovation Research Park and contains&nbsp;most of the department’s physical oceanography laboratories. The Department maintains a 55-foot research vessel, R/V Fay Slover, primarily for estuarine and coastal studies. In addition to R/V Slover, the Department has a number of small boats suitable for near-shore investigations.</p>",

Chemistry has been called the \"central science\" because it makes major contributions to agriculture, biology, electronics, engineering, environmental science, medicine, mineralogy and pharmacology. Either undergraduate degree program gives the student the necessary background for continued academic study at the master's and PhD levels, entry into medical, dental, and pharmacy schools, as well as a career in the chemical industry. Students not only gain an excellent education, but also have many research opportunities available to enrich their understanding of real-world problems. Cooperative arrangements exist with the nearby Eastern Virginia Medical School, NASA Langley Research Center and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.</p>\n<h2>Preparation for Medically Related Fields</h2>\n<p>Students seeking careers in pharmacy, medicine, dentistry, or veterinary science are advised to complete a major in a specific discipline. Such students electing either chemistry or biochemistry as their major must meet all of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in chemistry or biochemistry. In addition, students must complete all of the prerequisite coursework specified for admission into the professional program of their choice. Students should consult the Office of Admissions of such professional programs for specific prerequisite coursework and other entrance requirements. Students are also advised to register with the Prehealth Advisory Committee at Old Dominion University (683-6790).</p>\n<h2>Advanced Placement</h2>\n<p>Students who receive a qualifying score on the Advanced Placement of the College Board exam in chemistry may receive credit for introductory chemistry courses. The appropriate credit will be determined after consultation with an advisor.&nbsp; See the equivalency charts on the ODU website at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.odu.edu/academics/academic-records/score-analysis/ap-ib\">https://www.odu.edu/academics/academic-records/score-analysis/ap-ib</a>.&nbsp; Students may also refer to the section of this Catalog on Prior Learning Assessment Credit Options at the Undergraduate Level.</p>",

A minor in Ocean and Earth Science is also offered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The department receives considerable support from the Commonwealth and local philanthropic sources, as well as from private industry and area citizens. Establishment of the Virginia Graduate Marine Science Consortium by the General Assembly in 1979 demonstrated the Commonwealth's determination to achieve excellence in marine science. The purpose of the consortium is to advance marine science instruction, research, training, and advisory services and to enhance Virginia's position in seeking funding to carry out these activities. Charter members of the consortium are Old Dominion University, the University of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and the College of William and Mary. The Samuel L. and Fay M. Slover endowment to Old Dominion University in 1986 has significantly accelerated the program of marine studies. In 1991, a Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography (CCPO) was established at Old Dominion University by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The center is a Designated Center for Excellence.</p>\n<p>The Department of Ocean and Earth Sciences is housed in two buildings. The Oceanography/Physical Sciences Building contains state-of-the-art teaching laboratories, computer facilities, and research laboratories for biological, chemical and geological oceanography. The Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography is located in the Research I building and houses all of the department's physical oceanography laboratories. The department maintains a 55-foot research vessel, the R/V Fay Slover, primarily for estuarine and coastal studies. In addition to the Slover, the department has a number of small boats suitable for near shore investigations.</p>\n<p><strong>Practicum Experiences</strong></p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">Students in the Ocean and Earth Science majors have the chance to participate in a practicum—a hands-on, course-length experience that closely ties their classroom learning with \"real life.\"&nbsp; Students in &nbsp;Oceanography, Geology, Environmental Science, and Marine Science Technology take <a href=\"/search/?P=OEAS%20307\">OEAS 307</a>, Research Experience in Oceanography.

It seeks to facilitate the development of intellectual skills and characteristics that enhance the student's lifelong personal and career success. The program begins with a general psychology course and includes courses in quantitative methods and experimental design. Additional coursework is selected from a broad range of available courses. Students are encouraged to pursue breadth across the areas of psychology, particularly when planning for advanced study in psychology. The department does, however, identify sets of courses particularly relevant for students interested in health, clinical, industrial/organizational, or human factors (engineering) psychology.</p>\n<h2>Psychology Awards</h2>\n<p>The Alan L. Chaikin Psychology Honors Thesis Award is given each year to a student in the Department of Psychology for the outstanding honors thesis.</p>\n<p>The Elizabeth C. Guy Outstanding Psychology Service Award is given each year to the student selected by the faculty who has contributed significant service to the department or field of psychology. Service is primarily defined as participation in departmental, University, community, or professional organizations. However, other qualifications, such as research activity, may be considered. Eligible students must have a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 and 18 credits in psychology at Old Dominion University.</p>\n<p>The Elizabeth C. Guy Outstanding Psychology Academic Award is given each year to the graduating senior with the highest overall grade point average. To be eligible, a student will have completed a minimum of 60 hours at Old Dominion University by graduation. Further, the student will have completed a minimum of 18 psychology credits at Old Dominion University. In the case where two or more students meet the criteria and have identical GPAs, the student with the highest number of credit hours earned at Old Dominion University will receive the award.</p>\n<p>The Michael Greenspan/ODU Psychology Study Abroad Award is given each year to a selected psychology major to study psychology at one of ODU's partner institutions in the United Kingdom.
