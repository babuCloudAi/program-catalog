It will focus on the Afro- Latinx narrative forms coming out of Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United states. Through examining the narrative expressions of Blackness throughout regions of Latin America students can consider the relationship that social historical processes such as colonialism, nation-making and continued racism have on narrative production. Key to this course will be examining the ways race and gender/sexuality intersect within the multiple forms of expression of the Afro-Latinx community. Readings and lectures in English.",
