        "courseDescription": "This course covers a combination of motor development and motor learning topics. The course information and structure are designed to optimize practitioners' effectiveness in the classroom and on the field via practical application of motor behavior theories, concepts and principles. Attention is directed toward understanding the acquisition of skills from the fundamental, initial level to the sport-specific, more advanced level, toward optimal age and skill-level practices and developing appropriate motor skill assessments for infants through older adulthood. Past and current research findings are incorporated into each of the course topics.",
