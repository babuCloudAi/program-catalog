        "courseDescription": "Students will study law as seen through the lens of fiction.  Assignments draw heavily from classic and contemporary novels, short stories, plays, films, and perhaps television.  As these artistic representations of law in action are explored, short theoretical readings help focus on questions of philosophy, politics, and justice.  The course also explores the relationship between fiction and reality through appellate opinions and contemporary literature on the American legal system.  The goal is to come to a better understanding of the potential blessings, dangers, and limitations of law.",
