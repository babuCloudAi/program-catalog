In this course, students build upon and practice lesson design skills developed in Step 1 while also becoming familiar with exemplary mathematics or science curricula at the middle school level. With the guidance of the master teacher, students engage in one observation and prepare and teach three inquiry-based lessons in a middle school classroom. Students incorporate and demonstrate their content knowledge in developing the inquiry-based lessons. At the end of Step 2, students are generally ready to make a decision about whether they want to pursue a pathway to teacher licensure through the MonarchTeach program.",
