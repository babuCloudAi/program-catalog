The first semester a student takes the course, they take a \"junior\" role where they are learning about and the process of working with their client. Repeat students take more senior roles, where they interface more extensively with the client and become leaders of teams of students and of bigger projects with more responsibility. The tools/software they learn will change each semester, as will their client, making the course a different experience each time and allowing them to grow into leadership positions that will transition well into project manager or creative director roles outside the university.",
