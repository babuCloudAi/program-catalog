Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering. Continuance in a linked bachelor's/master's program requires maintenance of a GPA of 3.00 or higher overall and in the major.",
        "Bachelor-to-PhD Programs": "For a select number of exceptionally well-qualified students, the college has established a linked doctoral program that enables students to be admitted directly into the PhD program upon completion of the baccalaureate degree. A select number of exceptionally well-qualified students can be admitted to the Bachelor/PhD program in their junior year while they are pursuing one of the undergraduate programs at Old Dominion University. This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. Just as in the linked Bachelor/MS program, six credit hours of graduate course work may again be counted towards the undergraduate degree and doctoral course work mentioned above for the Bachelor/PhD program. For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

        "Policy on Readmission": "Subsequent to dismissal or withdrawal for academic deficiencies, readmission may be sought through reapplication to the Dental Hygiene Program. A student who must repeat one or more courses in the dental hygiene major must first be readmitted to the dental hygiene program. In order to initiate the readmission process, the student shall submit a letter to the School of Dental Hygiene, requesting readmission to the program, with supporting documents to include a copy of official transcripts and letter of intention indicating the reasons why he/she should be reconsidered and proposed goals for achieving academic success no later than one month after dismissal date.  A cumulative GPA of 3.0 will make the candidate competitive for readmission consideration. Students dismissed for violations of the Student Code of Conduct and Academic Integrity are ineligible for readmission. Once the School of Dental Hygiene has processed the letter of intent and official transcripts, the admissions committee will consider the student for readmission. The process of reconsideration will include a careful review of the student’s academic records, the letter of intent, and an assessment of potential for academic progress in the future by a readmission committee. Recommendations relative to readmission will be referred to the School of Dental Hygiene Chair in conjunction with the Chief Department Advisor and Office of Admissions for final decision and notification, including conditions for readmission, where appropriate. Readmitted students are allowed to repeat a failed course only once.  A student may be readmitted to the dental hygiene major only once.  A student who leaves the major and is readmitted will be required to take additional course work prior to or concurrent with readmission.  Readmission will be granted on a space-available basis only after regular admission has been filled.  Appeal of readmission decisions should be directed to the School of Dental Hygiene Chair."

An eligible student can choose a master's program in the same discipline as his/her bachelor's program or in a complementary discipline. Subject to the approval of the undergraduate and graduate program directors, a student enrolled in a linked program can count up to six credit hours of course work towards both the undergraduate and the graduate degrees. Full-time students may be able to complete the requirements for the bachelor's degree in four years and the master's degree in one additional year.  Students in linked programs must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering. Continuance in a linked bachelor's/master's program requires maintenance of a GPA of 3.00 or higher overall and in the major.",
        "Bachelor-to-PhD Programs": "For a select number of exceptionally well-qualified students, the college has established a linked doctoral program that enables students to be admitted directly into the PhD program upon completion of the baccalaureate degree. A select number of exceptionally well-qualified students can be admitted to the Bachelor/PhD program in their junior year while they are pursuing one of the undergraduate programs at Old Dominion University. This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. Just as in the linked Bachelor/MS program, six credit hours of graduate course work may again be counted towards the undergraduate degree and doctoral course work mentioned above for the Bachelor/PhD program. For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. Just as in the linked Bachelor/MS program, six credit hours of graduate course work may again be counted towards the undergraduate degree and doctoral course work mentioned above for the Bachelor/PhD program. For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

This includes clinical tests within the areas of chemistry, microbiology, hematology, immunology/serology, urinalysis, immunohematology (blood banking), and molecular pathology. The program has been continually accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences, 5600 N River Road, Suite 720, Rosemont, IL 60018, 773 714-8880. Due to accreditation, upon successful completion of the program graduates are eligible to take the national certification exam for Medical Laboratory Scientist, administered by the American Society for Clinical Pathology, MLS(ASCP).",
        "Admission": "Admission to the University does not constitute admission to the medical laboratory science program. Students are admitted to the program after completion of two years of college study, which includes all program prerequisite courses.  All program prerequisite courses must be completed with a grade of C (2.00) or better.  Additionally, applicants must be in good academic standing (cumulative GPA 2.0 or greater). The students then enter two years of a combined didactic and clinical phase congruent with the 2 + 2 concept. A grade of C (2.00) or better is required in all medical laboratory science course work for continuance in the program. The program does not offer just the final clinical phase to transfer applicants from 3 + 1 programs. Applications to the program, including all materials, must be submitted no later than February 1 for consideration for admission the following fall. Exemptions may be appealed only through the program director. Prospective students who fail to meet the February 1 deadline for formal admission may be allowed to take on-campus medical laboratory science/medical technology courses on a space-available basis. Permission must be first granted by the program director in advance of registration."

The Naval ROTC program is administratively located under the Director of Military Activities and is situated, for academic matters, within the Batten College of Engineering and Technology. The NROTC program consists of two courses of instruction: the four-year program and the two-year program. Both apply to scholarship and non-scholarship (college program) students. The four-year program is divided into a two-year basic course and a two-year advanced course. The basic course is normally pursued by NROTC midshipmen during their freshman and sophomore years. While most freshmen begin the basic course during the fall, it is possible to enter the program in the spring semester."

Students who are enrolled in an AAS/ADN program typically take 1-2 ODU RN-BSN courses each semester in addition to their courses. As part of ODUGlobal, the ODU nursing courses are offered in an on-line program of study. The concurrent scheduling option is for students who have completed all lower-division departmental and general education courses for the BSN and are enrolled in an RN program at a partner institution.  Advisors work with students to develop an individual plan of study to fulfill the requirements. Following graduation from the AAS/ADN program and successful completion of the NCLEX RN licensure exam, the student will be awarded 33 nursing transfer credits toward completion of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. Fall, Spring and Summer enrollment is available. The Concurrent Enrollment option contributes to the BSN prepared workforce as well as prepares RNs for graduate programs by creating a seamless progression from the AAS to the BSN. Graduates of the baccalaureate program in professional nursing are generalists prepared to care for culturally diverse individuals and groups across the lifespan in a complex global community. Upon completion of the innovative, technology-enhanced program, graduates are knowledgeable about current trends in health care, assume responsibility for their professional growth, and are prepared for graduate study in nursing.

        "Physics with a Major in Secondary Physics Education (6-12)": "Due to changing University requirements, national accreditation standards, and the Virginia Board of Education licensure regulations, the teacher preparation programs in the College of Sciences are under constant revision. Any changes resulting from these factors supersede the program requirements described in this Catalog. Students are encouraged to obtain current program information from their advisors and the Office of Clinical Experiences website at https://www.odu.edu/oce.",
        "Admission": "Students must first declare secondary physics education as their major with the physics departmental advisor. All students must apply for and be admitted into the approved secondary physics education program. Students must meet the required criteria for admission by earning the minimum required grade point averages (GPA).",
        "Virginia Board of Education Prescribed Assessments for Admission to an Approved Teacher Education Program": "Old Dominion University students seeking admission to an approved teacher education program must satisfy the Virginia Board of Education required assessment for admission into an approved teacher education program. The requirement can be satisfied by meeting a passing score in the following: Virginia Communication and Literacy Assessment (VCLA): Scaled passing score of 235 for the reading subtest and score of 235 for the writing subtest OR a composite score of 470 for the assessment. For the most current information on the prescribed Virginia Board of Education admission assessment, visit the Virginia Department of Education at https://www.doe.virginia.gov/.",
        "Required Grade Point Averages (GPA)": "Although students may enroll in a limited number of education courses, students must be admitted into the approved physics teacher preparation program prior to enrolling in any instructional strategies practicum education course. Students must also meet with an education advisor in the Office of Clinical Experiences.",
        "Continuance": "Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.75, a major/content GPA of 2.75 and a professional education GPA of 2.75. Physics courses must be passed with a grade of C- or higher. The remaining courses required for the major and in the professional education core must be completed with a grade of C- or higher for continuance. A professional education GPA of 2.75 is required for continuance. Students must take and pass the Praxis Subject Assessment, Physics content knowledge (formerly Praxis II) prior to or while enrolled in the instructional strategies course. All assessments must be passed prior to the start of the Teacher Candidate Internship Orientation session.",
        "Background Clearance Requirement": "Old Dominion University requires a background clearance check of candidates interested in many of the professional education programs.  Professional education programs have several field experiences that are required for continuance and graduation from the program.  The background clearance must be successfully completed prior to a field experience placement. Candidates will be provided a field experience placement when the background check process is completed with resolution of any issues. The process to complete the ODU clearance background check is located at:  http://www.odu.edu/success/academic/teacher-education/placement/background-checks.  The ODU clearance process includes:  an FBI fingerprint, a child protective service/social service review, and a Virginia State Police sex offender registry review. Candidates interested in the professional education programs are advised to complete this clearance process immediately upon entry into the program since the clearance process takes a minimum of eight weeks to complete.",

The internship is a planned, supervised, and evaluated 200-hour experience under the direction of the internship coordinator. (Note: Students enrolled in the linked BSPH to MPH program are required to perform 120 hours as those students take graduate-level courses and are required to complete an Applied Practice Experience/practicum in the graduate program.) The policies, guidelines, and processes followed by the coordinator and students are delineated in the Internship Manual provided to students when they enroll in the program. The internship provides the opportunity for students to integrate their academic work into experiential learning to gain additional experience in the field or community of the student's choice. The experience will allow a student to gain basic job entry or advanced skills by working with experienced public health or healthcare professionals in a public or private organization. Students may select the internship site, or they may seek guidance from faculty about possible sites. Students may be eligible for internship upon senior standing in the major (at least 90 credits) and completion of all required prerequisites. Senior standing is imperative for success in the internship course as the foundational skills and concepts are achieved during the span of entire coursework at ODU. Internships must be sought and undertaken in an organization, agency, department, or community that provides planning and/or services that are relevant to the core areas of public health. Any student who plans to organize an internship without the appropriate foundation may be at a disadvantage in the organizations in which internships are undertaken. All public health students will complete an internship related to public health. The internship experience and corresponding internship course both address the relevance of developing skills and competencies as required for the future of public health practitioners. As part of the course assessment, students are required to develop an electronic portfolio (ePortfolio). The ePortfolio is a collection of work completed by the student during the internship and can be used to present the student’s “professional” or digital self to others. In addition to submitting an ePortfolio, students must submit a comprehensive attendance record that covers the entire internship period. Students who have five or more years of supervisory or management experience in a public health field can apply for a Prior Learning ePortfolio Challenge, which could replace the internship course.  A cover letter and resume will be required for initial review. Please contact the BSPH internship coordinator to discuss this option. Some internship sites may require the student to complete a criminal background check, drug screening, computer-based training, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) training, proof of vaccination status, and/or other relevant responsibilities needed to train in public health organizations prior to beginning the internship. Students who do not pass the internship in the first attempt will have the opportunity to repeat the course one additional time. If they are unsuccessful on their final attempt, they will be unable to earn the Bachelor of Science in Public Health."

The theatre advisor will determine which transferable courses will meet the cognate program requirements and which theatre and professional courses must be completed for licensure. All content area courses must be completed with a grade of C or better, and all professional education courses must be completed with a grade of C- or better. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.75 overall, in the major and in the professional education core is required for continuance and licensure. Although students may enroll in a limited number of education courses, passing scores for the Virginia Board of Education prescribed assessment for admission must be on file with the Office of Clinical Experiences prior to enrollment in any education practicum course or courses in developing instructional strategies. It is recommended that students take the Virginia Board of Education prescribed assessment for admission prior to, or during, enrollment in TLED 301."
