### Overview
Frank Holman, Graduate Program Director

Objective: To provide a curriculum that facilitates the promotion of professional judgment/skepticism and critical thinking skills that add value in decision making.

Focus: Students have the option of aligning coursework based on two areas of interest (concentrations): _Financial Management_ addresses the needs of students who have an interest in operational and financial decision making, and _Taxation_ provides the requisite skills set for those interested in tax compliance and planning. Both associate with careers in Public Accounting, Industry, or Government/Not-For-Profit organizations and prepare students for the CPA and other professional designations/licenses (i.e. CMA, CIA, CFE, CISA, CGFM, etc.).
