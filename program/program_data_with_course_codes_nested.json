Additionally, the office serves all Strome College of Business students as a satellite of the Center for Career & Leadership Development, assisting students with internships and job placement.\n\nAdditionally, the Center assists students with information and access to supplemental success programs and tools such as peer tutoring, mentoring, and the Tanner Business Fellows.",

Students in the linked BSBA/MS program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree).\n\nA student may apply to the linked BSBA/MS program after completing ACCT 305 and 12 hours from ACCT 306, ACCT 307, ACCT 311, ACCT 425, or ACCT 426 with a C or better. Students must have an overall grade point average of 3.00 in all course work taken at Old Dominion University to be admitted to the linked program. Students must apply for admission to the MS program after completion of the undergraduate degree. Students should note that being in the undergraduate accounting major does not guarantee acceptance to the MS program.\n\nOnce admitted to the linked program, a student will take 600-level core graduate accounting courses, and these courses will be applied to the MS course requirements as long as the student already has 120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree. By completing these nine hours, students will only have 21 hours to complete in the MS program during an additional year of study after graduating from the undergraduate program as long as the student earns 120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree for a total of 150 credit hours.",
