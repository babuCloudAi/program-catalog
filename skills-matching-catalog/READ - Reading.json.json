    "Action Research in Reading": {
        "Description": "This course will introduce students to action research, a form of self-reflective, systematic inquiry by educators of their own practice.  Students will learn about research methods, design, and implementation, and they will develop action research proposals based on a line of structured inquiry emanating from events occurring within their own classrooms.  Teachers will study student learning related to their own teaching, a process which allows them to learn about their own instructional practices and to continue monitoring improved student learning.  Conducting action research provides educators with an avenue to reflect on their own teaching practices with the aid of empirical data and engage in self-directed learning with the ultimate goal of improving student learning.  Must have completed 15 Graduate credit hours in reading coursework.",
