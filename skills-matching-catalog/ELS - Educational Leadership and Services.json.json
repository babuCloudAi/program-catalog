The course focuses contemporary problems that confront school leaders as they work to improve the conditions of learning for their students, faculty, and staff.  To effectively address and solve problems school leaders need to understand the processes of policymaking at various educational levels and to develop the relevant skills of policymaking needed at the school level.  Thus, this course addresses the following three essential principles of educational politics and policy as they apply to school level administrators: political and policy dynamics that influence their work in schools; accurately identify, diagnose, and develop the right solutions to the right problems in order to achieve instructional goals of the school and division; and confront, engage in, and effectively deal with conflict (i.e., politics) emanating from within the school, division, or community in order to achieve school and division learning goals.",
