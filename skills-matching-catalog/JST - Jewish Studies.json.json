    "Holocaust and Genocide Studies": {
        "Description": "After the atrocities of the Holocaust, 'Never again!' has been repeated throughout the world. However, the reality is that genocide did not begin or end with the Holocaust. This course uses the Holocaust as a case study in genocide, tracing the history of anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism in Europe through its reappropriation by Adolf Hitler. Through an interdisciplinary approach to the Holocaust where history, literature, film, and oral narratives are considered, students establish a basis for critiquing and understanding other genocides. The course will culminate with an analysis of contemporary genocide, taking into consideration how the genocides and the Holocaust inform our worldview of hatred and impact societies and cultures.",
