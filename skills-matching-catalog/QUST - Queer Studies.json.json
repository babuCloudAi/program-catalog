    "Queer Literature": {
        "Description": "This course provides a historical sampling of queer literary voices in the U.S. Students explore fiction, poetry, drama, and visual literary forms through the lens of queer theory. Students investigate the ways in which queer authors and subjects have been excluded from the traditional canon and how readers, academics, critics, and authors of anthologies have ignored or obscured queer possibilities and homoeroticism in literary works. Students also explore the benefits of thinking of queer literary works as queer literatures (in the plural sense rather than the singular Queer Literature) and attempt to answer the question, is there such a thing as Queer Literature?",
