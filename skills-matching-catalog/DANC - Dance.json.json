The Extreme Moves training method focuses on the body\u2019s alignment with regard to how forces are present, how they act upon it, and how to build strength to resist or collaborate with these forces. Students will work with props such as large physio balls, elastic bands, mats and the wall in order to improve their core strength, balance, upper and lower body strength and alignments. Through physical practice, readings and videos, students will learn the conceptual framework for Extreme Moves.",
