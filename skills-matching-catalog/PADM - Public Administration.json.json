In the U.S., some of the disparities have been created by explicit and intentional discrimination that was incorporated into the U.S. Constitution and various federal, state, and local laws.  Other disparities grew out of unconscious or unintended impacts of federal, state, and local laws, policies, and practices.  This course will examine these issues within the context of public administration, developing an awareness of inequities and the skills to dismantle discriminatory policies and practices.",
