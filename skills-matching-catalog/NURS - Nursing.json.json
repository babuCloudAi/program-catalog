Basic principles of palliative care are presented within a quality of life (QOL) framework. Palliative care nursing care combines caring, communication, knowledge, and skill. Clinical issues to include expert assessment skills and aggressive pain and symptom management as well as the psychological, social, and spiritual care of patients and families experiencing a life threatening progressive illness will be discussed. Caring for the dying means not only \"doing for\" but also \"being with\". Students will be provided the opportunity to use introspection to clarify their own feelings related to the dying process. A student receiving credit for NURS 357 cannot receive credit for NURS 457.",
