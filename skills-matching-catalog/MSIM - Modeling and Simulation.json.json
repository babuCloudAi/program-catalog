This paradigm, known as systemic thinking, will be contrasted with traditional systematic thinking, and practical guidelines for the deployment of a systemic thinking approach will be provided.  This paradigm will increase the student's ability to make rational decisions in complex environments.  (Cross listed with ENMA 802).",
