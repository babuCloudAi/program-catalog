The interpretation of human visual culture \u2013 particularly from ancient periods \u2013 is a particularly subjective endeavor, but in recent years social media have accelerated the proliferation of baseless theories about art, architecture, and material culture. From alien-builder theories to simple misconceptions about the polychromatic nature of Classical art, these pseudoarchaeologies can be found throughout the world, but they tend to harangue and ultimately undermine non-European peoples and cultures and their cultural heritage.",

Students will explore how text and visual imagery informed one another, and closely examine works of art by women artists, commissioned by women patrons, and works featuring women through thematic topics. Although patriarchy dominated the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the course will recover the histories of women artists, patrons, and writers, and examine how women navigated the gender oppression of their periods to reclaim their power and value.",
