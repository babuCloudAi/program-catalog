      "Overview": "Accounting, as the world's oldest information system, provides information for most government, non-profit, and business decisions. Accounting graduates pursue successful careers in the public or private sectors.  The undergraduate program in accounting at Old Dominion University is one of a select group in the country with separate accreditation from AACSB-International. The program provides a broad-based education with a variety of career objectives. The Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) in accounting provides students with technical accounting knowledge, the ability to analyze problems, communicate solutions, interact with colleagues, and successfully handle ethical issues appropriate for staff-level positions.  The program provides, at a minimum, 24 hours of accounting, which is sufficient for a graduate to sit for most accounting professional licensure and certification exams.A student who seeks a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree in accounting from Old Dominion University must, in addition to meeting other requirements of the University, earn a minimum of 25 percent of the total number of credits required for the degree (for example, 30 credits in a 120-credit degree program) through on- or off-campus instruction.",

Honors Research\n\nUndergraduates with junior or senior standing and a GPA of 3.00 or better are eligible to participate in Honors Research. After consultation with the program director (Dr. Deborah A. Waller), students select a professor who agrees to oversee the research project. Students then enroll in two courses, BIOL 487 and  BIOL 488W. The courses may be taken in any sequence: fall-spring, spring-summer, summer-summer, summer-fall. Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements.\n\nB. Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Biological Sciences and Honors Designation for Biology courses\n\nStudents maintaining an overall GPA of at least 3.25 and of 3.50 in biology can receive a \"Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Biological Sciences\" subject to satisfaction of the minimum University standards for the Honors degree and completion of one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Successful completion of two semesters of biological research taken as BIOL 487 / BIOL 488W (Honors Research).\n\nOption 2: Successful completion of three upper-division courses in Biological Sciences and achievement of the \"Honors\" designation in each.\n\nStudents petitioning for designation of an upper-division biology course as \"Honors\" must have a minimum overall GPA of 3.25 and a GPA of at least 3.50 in biology.\n\nTo receive the \"Honors\" designation for a course, students must achieve a final course score of at least 95% or the equivalent of an \"A\" on the University grade scale.\n\nFaculty are encouraged to assign and work with students on other activities deemed appropriate for an \"Honors\" course designation and utilize the results of these activities in the assignment of a course grade."

Students then enroll in two courses, BIOL 487 and  BIOL 488W. The courses may be taken in any sequence: fall-spring, spring-summer, summer-summer, summer-fall. Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements.\n\nB.

Honors Research\n\nUndergraduates with junior or senior standing and a GPA of 3.00 or better are eligible to participate in Honors Research. After consultation with the program director (Dr. Deborah A. Waller), students select a professor who agrees to oversee the research project. Students then enroll in two courses, BIOL 487 and  BIOL 488W. The courses may be taken in any sequence: fall-spring, spring-summer, summer-summer, summer-fall. Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements.\n\nB. Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Biological Sciences and Honors Designation for Biology courses\n\nStudents maintaining an overall GPA of at least 3.25 and of 3.50 in biology can receive a \"Bachelor's Degree with Honors in Biological Sciences\" subject to satisfaction of the minimum University standards for the Honors degree and completion of one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Successful completion of two semesters of biological research taken as BIOL 487 / BIOL 488W (Honors Research).\n\nOption 2: Successful completion of three upper-division courses in Biological Sciences and achievement of the \"Honors\" designation in each.\n\nStudents petitioning for designation of an upper-division biology course as \"Honors\" must have a minimum overall GPA of 3.25 and a GPA of at least 3.50 in biology.\n\nTo receive the \"Honors\" designation for a course, students must achieve a final course score of at least 95% or the equivalent of an \"A\" on the University grade scale.\n\nFaculty are encouraged to assign and work with students on other activities deemed appropriate for an \"Honors\" course designation and utilize the results of these activities in the assignment of a course grade."

Students graduating from the program pursue careers in graphic design studios and advertising agencies throughout the country, or continue their education in MFA programs.\n\nThe program provides a solid foundation of traditional art experiences and design practices and principles to build students’ ability to create dynamic visual solutions. The core graphic design curriculum stresses essential competencies in conceptual problem solving, research, analysis and articulation, aesthetics, design theory, productivity, and the application of technology, necessary for both advanced exploration and entry into professional practice.\n\nAll graphic design students can expect a creative and collaborative environment built upon the experience of a faculty of practicing designers and design educators. Limited enrollment and class sizes ensure an intense and individualized course of study leading to a competitive portfolio for entry into the profession. The department's dedicated state-of-the-art facilities include classroom and production spaces built and equipped to facilitate instruction and invention with traditional and digital media. The program strongly encourages and supports critical interaction with the design community through internships, professional memberships, and participation in design competitions.\n\nGraphic Design Major Requirements\n\nIntended students in the graphic design program are expected to successfully complete the required art studio foundations coursework during the first year of study.

Refer to the MUSC 311+ syllabus and the Music Student Handbook for complete information.\n\nAdditional Requirements and Information\n\nEnsemble Options for Bachelor of Music and Music BA Majors\n\nEach degree program has specific ensemble requirements, which are listed under the course requirements above.\n\nFor the purposes of fulfilling large ensemble requirements, students may use only wind ensemble, symphony orchestra, guitar ensemble, concert choir, or symphonic band (based on general wind/brass/percussion ensemble audition). \n\nFor the purposes of fulfilling small ensemble requirements, students may use a variety of ensembles including, but not limited to: madrigal singers,  opera workshop, new music ensemble, Diehn chorale, brass choir, contemporary music ensemble, clarinet choir, flute choir, jazz choir, jazz orchestra, jazz combo, chamber music groups of varied sizes and instrumentation (brass, woodwind, percussion, guitar, string, piano, mixed ensembles, etc.), saxophone quartet, collegium musicum, and more. Small ensemble offerings may vary each semester; check the class schedule for the latest ensemble availability. Small ensemble offerings are updated on occasion; check the class schedule for the latest ensemble availability. Small ensemble participation should be made in consultation with the appropriate Area Director/s, Applied Instructors, and Program Advisors.\n\nOther ensembles are offered for credit, such as and including Athletic Bands. Some ensembles are also open to non-music majors with enrollment based on an audition and instrumentation needs. \n\nAll of these ensembles are led by and/or coached by a DSoM faculty member.\n\nStudents should be aware of the necessity for ensemble diversity, and are encouraged to participate in as many different ensembles as their schedules and advisors will allow.\n\nApplied Lesson Continuance Policy\n\nIf a student fails two semesters of applied lessons, he or she will be required to re-audition for applied lesson placement and may be advised to choose another degree program that does not require applied lessons. If a student has five or more unexcused absences in one semester, he or she will fail applied music for that semester. An audition is required to re-enter applied music after an absence of two consecutive semesters or more.\n\nJury Examinations\n\nApplied music students taking hour lessons at the MUSA 141 level or higher must play a jury examination each semester. Failure to perform a required jury will result in a final applied grade of F. The jury grade counts as 50% of the final applied grade. The remaining 50% is based on progress in lessons and is determined by the student's teacher. Students auditing Applied Music take juries in the first semester in which they are enrolled for credit. Audit status is normally allowed for one semester only and is granted on the auditioning committee's recommendation that the student will likely be ready for credit study after one semester of audit study. A student with audit status will audition for credit study during the jury examination period at the close of the audit semester.\n\nAccompanying\n\nAll keyboard students are expected to accompany at least once a semester on a General Student Recital, Performance Session, or Applied Music Jury Examination after they have attained the Applied Music numbering of 241 and above or 251 and above, and after they have studied keyboard at Old Dominion University for a minimum of one semester."

College program students supplement classroom instruction with at-sea training during the summer between their junior and senior years. Similarly, Marine Corps option students attend the six-week Marine Officer Candidate School at Quantico, Virginia during the summer between their junior and senior years.\n\nThe two-year NROTC program is extended to students who do not participate in NROTC during their freshman and sophomore years. Applications to join must be submitted during the sophomore year. If accepted for an unaffiliated scholarship, students will become a member of the unit upon acceptance and will be required to meet all NROTC standards and requirements.\n\nNuclear Power Option\n\nTo be most competitive, those students interested in entering the Navy's nuclear power program should have a college grade point average greater than 3.00. While any major is acceptable, all applicants must have completed at least two semesters of calculus (MATH 211 and MATH 212, or equivalent) and two semesters of calculus-based physics (PHYS 231N and PHYS 232N). Those students with a major in science, math, or engineering are most desirable. While not required, the following courses are recommended regardless of major for those students interested in navy nuclear power:\n\nModern Physics\nDifferential Equations\nThermodynamics (ME)\nPrinciples of Chemistry\nCircuit Analysis"
