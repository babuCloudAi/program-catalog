Individuals pursing a post-baccalaureate endorsement program must first apply for admission to Old Dominion University as a non-degree seeking graduate student; however, admission to Old Dominion University does not guarantee admission into post-baccalaureate endorsement or teacher preparation programs in the Darden College of Education and Professional Studies. Once admitted to the University, individuals must also apply for admission into a post-baccalaureate endorsement program and must meet the college’s policy for admitting students into an approved teacher education program.  The college offers four post-baccalaureate endorsement programs in special education: general curriculum K-12, adapted curriculum K-12, early childhood special education, and visual impairments prek-12.\n\nThe Post-Baccalaureate Endorsement Program offers the coursework required to satisfy the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) special educator licensure endorsement competencies. Due to changing national accreditation standards and state licensure regulations (i.e. assessments, certifications), the programs in teacher education are under constant revision. Students are encouraged to obtain current program information from the Special Education Program website at: http://www.odu.edu/cdse/academics/sped/grad. Program completers find employment as special education teachers within the continuum of services provided for children with special needs and may also serve as key members of child study teams; they are prepared to address the educational, emotional, and physical needs of students with disabilities."

      "Overview": "Dr. Jay K. Walker, Graduate Program Director\ngradecon@odu.edu \n\nEconomics is “the social science concerned with how individuals, institutions, and society make optimal choices under conditions of scarcity.” This is a broad field, covering everything from unemployment and inflation to stock market crashes and depressions, from perfect competition among firms to oligopoly and monopoly. Microeconomics studies firms, consumers, goods markets, resource markets, labor markets, and the price system. Macroeconomics studies unemployment, inflation, money supplies, interest rates, exchange rates, national debt, and economic growth.  Economics is generally concerned with the problems of incentives, wealth, poverty, and income distribution.\n\nEconomics provides a good background for jobs in business, banking, finance, marketing, law, government, politics, military, diplomacy, and journalism.  Our graduates have typically found economics positions in banks and firms, go to work in government, teach economics at community colleges, or enter MBA or Ph.D. programs in Economics and Finance.\n\nAttention International Students: Please note the M.A. Economics program is a STEM-designated degree according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. International students receiving the M.A. degree may apply for the extended OPT program which allows up to 3 years of work in the United States after program completion.\n\nEconomics is very important for the formulation of public policy, business strategies, and financial strategies and at the graduate level tends to be very quantitative.  In the Master of Arts in Economics program, students will develop strong mathematical and statistical skills, as well as learn about how the economy works.  Economists do economic analysis, make economic and econometric models of the economy, formulate economic policy, make business strategies, forecast economic variables, and do benefit-cost analysis. At the end of the program, an additional goal is that students will be prepared to earn the Certified Business Economist (CBE) designation from National Association for Business Economists (NABE).\n\nThe Old Dominion University Department of Economics is especially strong in regional economics, international economics, and econometrics. The department is the home of the Hampton Roads Regional Economic Forecasting Project and the State of the Region Report with our MA students often being involved in those projects.\n\nIf taken full time, the MA in Economics program can be easily completed within 21 months.  At a faster pace, the program can be completed in as little as 16 months.  Alternatively, the program can be completed attending part-time, but more time will be required.\n\nIf not taken as part of their prior undergraduate curriculum certain prerequisites must be completed before enrolling in MA core courses.  A student must have completed courses in calculus (3 hours), statistics (3 hours), and intermediate microeconomics or intermediate macroeconomics (3 hours from at least one of the two) with a grade of B or better.  If a potential student has not completed the pre-requisites, a provisional admission can be granted and these courses may be completed at Old Dominion University prior to taking the MA program core courses.\n\nThe MA program in Economics is more intensive than the Bachelor’s degree (BA/BS) in Economics.  The MA courses study economics at a deeper level than in the undergraduate courses, and are more mathematical.  Graduate students must maintain a grade point average of 3.0 or better.  All students in the program are trained in economic theory and research methods, and take several courses emphasizing business or government policy analysis in various specialty areas.  An independent research project is required, permitting students an opportunity to apply theory and empirical research techniques to real-world problems.\n\nThe Department of Economics encourages interdisciplinary training.  The Master’s program can be adapted for students desiring a diverse background by combining economics with graduate courses in sociology, political science, computer science, statistics, mathematics, finance, management, marketing research, or public administration."

Licensed teachers completing the program enhance their ability to teach effectively and to participate in educational research in their schools. Completion of the program requirements leads to the upgrade of the teaching license to the Postgraduate Professional level. The program of study consists of 30-credit hours, 18 credit hours taught in a cohort model with shared courses for students from the early childhood, elementary and secondary advanced master's degree programs. An additional three credit hours are completed as independent research/internship. The remaining nine credit hours focus explicitly on teaching and learning in the elementary grades. The MSEd - Elementary Education program for licensed teachers is offered online only. \n\nThe graduate program associated with this major is intended to meet the needs of the individual student. Program options are designed to accomplish three primary goals:\n\nto enhance classroom instruction by enriching the knowledge and skills of practicing teachers;\nto train and encourage classroom teachers to conduct in-school research so that significant findings in the learning-teaching process can be applied to the classroom situation; and\nto permit teachers to upgrade their teaching credentials to the Postgraduate Professional License level.\n\nCurricula for the program include specific courses that emphasize the inter-disciplinary nature of teaching in diverse settings. Topics addressed in courses include curricular and pedagogical principles, assessment, English language learners, teaching in the digital age, and culturally responsive teaching. Students also learn to engage in reflective inquiry and how to conduct practitioner inquiry that directly transforms instructional practice and beliefs about teaching. The program has four component areas:\n\nGeneral core;\nResearch core;\nElementary emphasis area; and\nCapstone experience.\n\nStudents must choose one of two capstone options – a research thesis and associated 3-credit hour thesis course (Thesis Option); or an internship experience and associated 3-credit hour internship course (Internship Option). The thesis option requires a successful defense of the thesis prospectus. The non-thesis internship option requires successful completion of a comprehensive examination covering program coursework."

Thus, all students in this program will have grounding in the same methods, principles, and philosophy of simulation. This provides the mechanisms for the simulationist to work across disciplines and domains while maintaining a common frame of reference for communication, technical specialization, and advanced study and research. The Master of Science (MS) in Modeling and Simulation offers two options: Thesis Option and Course Option.  The Thesis Option requires six hours of thesis credit and 24 hours of course credit and it is directed primarily at full-time students who are preparing for a career in advanced M&S research and/or academic positions.  The Course Option requires 30 hours of course credit and it is focused on developing the practical skills and knowledge needed to solve problems requiring applications of modeling and simulation.  The Course Option is further divided into two tracks: Development Track and Application Track.  The Development Track is programming intensive and prepares students for advanced simulation development, while the Application Track focuses on the usage of existing advanced simulation tools.\n\nThe program's subject core consists of:\n\nan overview of modeling and simulation;\nan in-depth exploration of specific simulation methodological approaches;\nsimulation system modeling principles and techniques;\nan introduction to computer visualization and visual simulation; and,\nprinciples of stochastic analysis.\n\nMost courses are offered in an online format. They are delivered to Old Dominion University's higher education centers and are available synchronously using video teleconferencing software."

Faculty are involved in research in the general areas of clinical, health, developmental, human factors, organizational, personnel, and community psychology.
