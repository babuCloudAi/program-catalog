Students then enroll in two courses, BIOL 487 and  BIOL 488W. The courses may be taken in any sequence: fall-spring, spring-summer, summer-summer, summer-fall. Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements."

Students then enroll in two courses, BIOL 487 and  BIOL 488W. The courses may be taken in any sequence: fall-spring, spring-summer, summer-summer, summer-fall. Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements."

Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements."

Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree)."

A student who must repeat one or more courses in the dental hygiene major must first be readmitted to the dental hygiene program. In order to initiate the readmission process, the student shall submit a letter to the School of Dental Hygiene, requesting readmission to the program, with supporting documents to include a copy of official transcripts and letter of intention indicating the reasons why he/she should be reconsidered and proposed goals for achieving academic success no later than one month after dismissal date.  A cumulative GPA of 3.0 will make the candidate competitive for readmission consideration. Students dismissed for violations of the Student Code of Conduct and Academic Integrity are ineligible for readmission. Once the School of Dental Hygiene has processed the letter of intent and official transcripts, the admissions committee will consider the student for readmission. The process of reconsideration will include a careful review of the student’s academic records, the letter of intent, and an assessment of potential for academic progress in the future by a readmission committee. Recommendations relative to readmission will be referred to the School of Dental Hygiene Chair in conjunction with the Chief Department Advisor and Office of Admissions for final decision and notification, including conditions for readmission, where appropriate. Readmitted students are allowed to repeat a failed course only once.  A student may be readmitted to the dental hygiene major only once.  A student who leaves the major and is readmitted will be required to take additional course work prior to or concurrent with readmission.  Readmission will be granted on a space-available basis only after regular admission has been filled.  Appeal of readmission decisions should be directed to the School of Dental Hygiene Chair."

Majoring in economics is a springboard to a wide variety of careers in business, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations.

For example, ECON 200S cannot be used to satisfy an elective requirement for students majoring in business administration. Also, IT 360T cannot be used as an elective by students majoring in Information Systems and Technology. Refer to the course description section of this Catalog for full details of courses and their prerequisites."

They must also pass the Praxis Subject Assessment, social studies content knowledge (formerly Praxis II) in order to be admitted to TLED 485 (Teacher Candidate Internship) and to be licensed. For information on these standardized tests, students should consult with their education advisor. To gain admission to this program, students must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.75 and maintain this average to graduate. Students must also have and maintain a major/content grade point average of 2.75 with grades of C- or higher in all history/social sciences courses and a professional education grade point average of 2.75 with all grades C- or higher in all education courses. The history/social sciences content consists of history, political science, geography, and economics. An optional specialization may be completed using students’ History electives; these specializations include Race, Gender, and Religion; War, Revolution, and Society; Mobilities and Migrations; History of Science and Technology; and Maritime History."

The students then enter two years of a combined didactic and clinical phase congruent with the 2 + 2 concept. A grade of C (2.00) or better is required in all medical laboratory science course work for continuance in the program. The program does not offer just the final clinical phase to transfer applicants from 3 + 1 programs. Applications to the program, including all materials, must be submitted no later than February 1 for consideration for admission the following fall. Exemptions may be appealed only through the program director. Prospective students who fail to meet the February 1 deadline for formal admission may be allowed to take on-campus medical laboratory science/medical technology courses on a space-available basis. Permission must be first granted by the program director in advance of registration."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree)."
