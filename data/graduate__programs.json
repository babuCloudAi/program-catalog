The program has two concentrations: Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and Language, Society, and Social Justice. Students may elect to pursue a concentration area by taking the required 9 credits of specialized coursework for each concentration or they may complete a general MA degree in Applied Linguistics without a concentration. Students in the program can complete their degree in-person on the main campus in Norfolk as well as by taking select courses synchronously online or asynchronously online. They may also earn a graduate certificate in TESOL and/or use appropriate courses in the program as requirements toward obtaining the Commonwealth of Virginia Endorsement for English as a Second Language."

After successful completion of the written examination, the student sits for an oral examination, which includes topics discussed in the written examination and any additional materials that the advisory committee feels are appropriate. The student will be expected to perform well on both the written and oral components of the examination. Rather than being merely pro forma, the oral examination is a serious and integral part of the qualifying procedure for candidacy. A student must pass both the written and oral sections.

Applicants are required to take the GRE general test. For the Information & Communications Technology concentration, the GMAT aptitude test may be used. Two letters of recommendation from faculty members of academic institutions are required in addition to all transcripts at the postsecondary level. For students whose native language is not English, either a TOEFL score of 550 (paper-based) and 79 (internet-based) or IELTS score of 6.5 is also required."

The written exam will be in a take-home format distributed during August. Details about the structure of the exam will be announced to students by the end of the spring semester before the exam. Student names will be removed from the exams for grading. No more than three faculty members will grade each section of the exam as “pass” or “fail” and more than one negative vote from the exam committee will result in a failure of the section. Students may pass or fail the exam in whole or in part. Students need to retake only those sections that are failed. Students who fail any section of the exam may register for fall classes but must retake the failed section in accordance with the directions stipulated by the comprehensive exam committee, generally in late November/early December of that same year. Students who do not successfully pass the written comprehensive exam following the retake will be dismissed from the program; they may complete the classes they are enrolled in that semester for credit if they wish. Students may not defend a dissertation proposal until they have passed the written comprehensive exam."

Enrollment in a weekly ecology seminar is required, on average, one semester each year. Professional experience (environmental management or teaching) is encouraged. A five-member advisory committee of faculty is selected to guide the student through his or her course of study and to provide initial approval of the dissertation research. This committee also administers the comprehensive written and oral candidacy examinations, which are taken after all required coursework is completed and the research skill requirement (proficiency in one foreign language, computer programming, or a quantitative skill approved by the advisory committee) is satisfied. The written exam must be passed before the oral exam may be taken. Once the candidacy exams are completed and a dissertation committee approves a written dissertation prospectus, the student advances to candidacy. At least three of the members of the original advisory committee, including the committee chair (student’s major advisor), will compose the dissertation committee. This committee approves a written dissertation prospectus and will supervise the research. At this time, the student’s attention turns almost exclusively to their own research. However, students continue to participate in seminar courses on a variety of topics, and an average of one seminar course per year of residency on campus is required. At the conclusion of their research, the student submits a dissertation to the committee and presents a public defense of this work."

Microeconomics studies firms, consumers, goods markets, resource markets, labor markets, and the price system. Macroeconomics studies unemployment, inflation, money supplies, interest rates, exchange rates, national debt, and economic growth.  Economics is generally concerned with the problems of incentives, wealth, poverty, and income distribution."

Each applicant must submit an essay of 500 words or less describing personal and academic goals, professional objectives, preparation for graduate study, and how the chosen program will help the applicant achieve these goals and objectives. Two letters of recommendation must be submitted from former or current professors, or employment supervisors. Regular admission to a master’s program generally requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale. Applicants with a lower undergraduate GPA may be considered for regular or provisional admission on the basis of successful engineering work experience or other credentials demonstrating potential for success in the graduate program. The submission of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required unless the applicant holds an ABET accredited engineering degree from an institution in the USA. TOEFL (or IELTS) is required for all applicants whose native language is not English unless their BS degrees are from USA institutions. Provisional admission may also be possible for applicants with a bachelor’s degree in a field other than the applicant’s intended graduate program. In such cases there will be prerequisite course requirements. Provisional admission may be given to those applicants who do not hold a bachelor’s degree in civil or environmental engineering; however, these students will be required to complete undergraduate course work in addition to the graduate program requirements.

Regular admission to a master’s program generally requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale. Applicants with a lower undergraduate GPA may be considered for regular or provisional admission on the basis of successful engineering work experience or other credentials demonstrating potential for success in the graduate program. The submission of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required unless the applicant holds an ABET accredited engineering degree from an institution in the USA. TOEFL (or IELTS) is required for all applicants whose native language is not English unless their BS degrees are from USA institutions. Provisional admission may also be possible for applicants with a bachelor’s degree in a field other than the applicant’s intended graduate program. In such cases there will be prerequisite course requirements. Provisional admission may be given to those applicants who do not hold a bachelor’s degree in civil or environmental engineering; however, these students will be required to complete undergraduate course work in addition to the graduate program requirements. Potential prerequisite courses are listed below."

For those applicants with non-engineering degrees, or with engineering degrees other than mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, or engineering mechanics, successful completion of remedial graduate coursework may be required as a condition of admission. The Master of Science programs requires a minimum of 24 semester credit hours of coursework beyond the bachelor’s degree with at least a B (3.0) average and a minimum of 6 semester credit hours of thesis research. The Master of Engineering program requires a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of course work with at least a B (3.0) average."

The purpose of the program's subject core is to provide a common academic foundation for all simulation students. Thus, all students in this program will have grounding in the same methods, principles, and philosophy of simulation. This provides the mechanisms for the simulationist to work across disciplines and domains while maintaining a common frame of reference for communication, technical specialization, and advanced study and research. The Master of Science (MS) in Modeling and Simulation offers two options: Thesis Option and Course Option.  The Thesis Option requires six hours of thesis credit and 24 hours of course credit and it is directed primarily at full-time students who are preparing for a career in advanced M&S research and/or academic positions.  The Course Option requires 30 hours of course credit and it is focused on developing the practical skills and knowledge needed to solve problems requiring applications of modeling and simulation.  The Course Option is further divided into two tracks: Development Track and Application Track.  The Development Track is programming intensive and prepares students for advanced simulation development, while the Application Track focuses on the usage of existing advanced simulation tools."

Students should construct concentrations under the guidance of an advisor, with advice from other mentors as needed.  Students must submit a proposal for the concentration that includes a title, a description of the focus, and a tentative or exemplary selection of at least three courses.  Both the advisor and the GPD must approve the proposal and place a signed approval letter in the student’s advising file.  Because course offerings may change, a final description of the concentration (including a title, a description of the focus, and a justification of how courses taken support the focus) must be approved by the student’s advisor (in a signed letter) and submitted with the letter to the GPD before the student enrolls in Dissertation Seminar."

While the defense is publicized and open to the public in general, care should be taken to ensure that all college faculty and administrators and all departmental students receive invitations to the defense. The entire dissertation committee must attend the final oral dissertation defense. After the dissertation defense, the dissertation committee meets in a closed-door meeting to discuss the dissertation defense and to vote on its approval or disapproval. If the dissertation is not approved, it can be defended only once more (no sooner than three months after the initial defense). The final dissertation must be approved through a signature process that includes the dissertation chair, all members of the dissertation committee, the graduate program director and the dean of the College of Health Sciences. Note that a dissertation may be approved orally at the final defense, but the committee may require some changes before the final copy is approved. Final approval of the written document is the responsibility of the associate dean of the college. The Doctor of Philosophy in Health Services Research will be awarded upon the oral defense of the dissertation, the submission of the final approved copy of the dissertation and the completion of all other program requirements for graduation."

While the defense is publicized and open to the public in general, care should be taken to ensure that all college faculty and administrators and all departmental students receive invitations to the defense. The entire dissertation committee must attend the final oral dissertation defense. After the dissertation defense, the dissertation committee meets in a closed-door meeting to discuss the dissertation defense and to vote on its approval or disapproval. If the dissertation is not approved, it can be defended only once more (no sooner than three months after the initial defense). The final dissertation must be approved through a signature process that includes the dissertation chair, all members of the dissertation committee, the graduate program director and the dean of the College of Health Sciences. Note that a dissertation may be approved orally at the final defense, but the committee may require some changes before the final copy is approved. Final approval of the written document is the responsibility of the associate dean of the college. The Doctor of Philosophy in Health Services Research will be awarded upon the oral defense of the dissertation, the submission of the final approved copy of the dissertation and the completion of all other program requirements for graduation."

This expectation is reflected in the program’s few traditional classroom course requirements beyond the master’s degree. The time should be spent on mostly research-related activities (e.g., reading, individual study [research], and dissertation). The student is expected to acquire research experiences that go well beyond formal course requirements. These research experiences may take a variety of forms and occur in a variety of settings. For example, the student is encouraged to engage in both laboratory and field research related to the HP sciences specialty, to serve as a member of a larger research team when appropriate or available (perhaps serving as a graduate research assistant on an externally sponsored grant), and to engage in independent non-sponsored research. The student is also encouraged to seek out opportunities to conduct research projects (including grants and contracts funded through the Old Dominion University Research Foundation) on his or her own and in collaboration with faculty members. The accumulation of these research experiences should result in presentation of papers at professional meetings, the publication of manuscripts in refereed journals, the publication of technical reports, and the submission of grant/contract proposals."

Although there are other ways to acquire these benefits (e.g., presentations at conferences, consulting experiences, organizing and conducting workshops), teaching a course systematically builds these experiences into a student’s plan of study. Moreover, any student who plans an academic career should teach one or more courses in preparation for that career. The student should also recognize that during the course of graduate training, financial support is often provided by the Psychology Department from graduate teaching assistant or adjunct teaching funds. This type of financial support almost always requires that the student be partially or fully responsible for teaching a course."

The examination consists of a  six-hour essay exam covering general HF knowledge (a reading list is provided) and a 10-page literature review covering knowledge in the student’s area of concentration (the literature review may be incorporated into the student’s dissertation proposal).  The literature review can be turned in any time during the semester, but MUST be submitted within a week of completion of the general knowledge essay exam. If the both written components are passed, the oral part of the examination must be completed within one month of notification. The oral exam covers the material contained on the candidate’s reading list, answers on the written exam, and the literature review. A student must pass both the written and oral parts to pass the candidacy examination.  The examination may not be reported as passed if there is more than one dissenting vote by exam committee members. A candidacy examination cannot be passed conditionally.  A pass on the examination cannot be made contingent upon other factors such as the completion of additional course work or the preparation of extra research projects.  If either part (written or oral) of the candidacy examination is failed, the faculty may permit the student to take it once more at a time mutually satisfactory but within 6 to 12 months from the date of the first examination.  If either part of the examination is failed, the student may be required by the faculty to retake only that part.  The student is allowed two attempts on the candidacy exam.  If the student fails the exam twice, they may be asked to leave the program.  When determining failure, the faculty considers a complete scheduled exam as one attempt.  Failure of one part of the exam on the first attempt (such as the written part), but then failure of a different part of the exam (even the oral part) at the second attempt is considered two failures."

A formal internship is highly recommended for students who lack significant experience in a public or nonprofit agency. Internships give students the opportunity to gain professional level experience and provide government or nonprofit agencies with the services of graduate students with high potential for future achievement. MPA students have the opportunity to earn up to three credits for an internship position, which will count as an elective course. PADM 668 Internship/Field Experience is the course students register for to earn credit for their public service experiences. Because the School of Public Service does not offer a comprehensive internship program within our department, these positions are most often acquired externally, though they must be approved by the MPA Graduate Program Director in order to count for course credit. Please contact the MPA Graduate Program Director with any questions you may have about internships or field experience projects: mpa@odu.edu."
