A guiding question will be: How do media and popular culture - as texts, practices, industries, and sites of identity formation and pleasure - construct race? Although students will theorize the politics of representation, they will also work to situate texts within a larger historic, political, and discursive context in order to assess the type of cultural work they perform.",
