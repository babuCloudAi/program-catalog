Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

After consultation with the program director (Dr. Deborah A. Waller), students select a professor who agrees to oversee the research project. Students then enroll in two courses, BIOL 487 and  BIOL 488W. The courses may be taken in any sequence: fall-spring, spring-summer, summer-summer, summer-fall. Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements.",

After consultation with the program director (Dr. Deborah A. Waller), students select a professor who agrees to oversee the research project. Students then enroll in two courses, BIOL 487 and  BIOL 488W. The courses may be taken in any sequence: fall-spring, spring-summer, summer-summer, summer-fall. Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements.",

Students then enroll in two courses, BIOL 487 and  BIOL 488W. The courses may be taken in any sequence: fall-spring, spring-summer, summer-summer, summer-fall. Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements.",

Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants.

Option 2: Successful completion of three upper-division courses in Biological Sciences and achievement of the \"Honors\" designation in each. Students petitioning for designation of an upper-division biology course as \"Honors\" must have a minimum overall GPA of 3.25 and a GPA of at least 3.50 in biology. To receive the \"Honors\" designation for a course, students must achieve a final course score of at least 95% or the equivalent of an \"A\" on the University grade scale. Faculty are encouraged to assign and work with students on other activities deemed appropriate for an \"Honors\" course designation and utilize the results of these activities in the assignment of a course grade.",

Normally both semesters are required but a student may receive credit for only one semester. The research project, time commitment by the student and the basis for the grade are mutually determined by the student and professor. Because first-semester research results are often preliminary, the grade for BIOL 487 is based on a review paper and/or research proposal, which provides the student with an overview of the field. The second semester is graded on the final research paper and a seminar presented to the honors committee and interested faculty. Professors should encourage students to publish results and present papers at scientific meetings when appropriate. Students should also be urged to apply for funds from agencies that provide seed money to undergraduates. The program director can provide information on scientific societies that sponsor meetings and/or offer small grants. Successful completion of both courses with a C (2.0) or better will allow the student to use BIOL 488W as a lab course in meeting his/her requirements.",

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Subject to the approval of the undergraduate and graduate program directors, a student enrolled in a linked program can count up to six credit hours of course work towards both the undergraduate and the graduate degrees. Full-time students may be able to complete the requirements for the bachelor's degree in four years and the master's degree in one additional year.  Students in linked programs must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering.

This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. Just as in the linked Bachelor/MS program, six credit hours of graduate course work may again be counted towards the undergraduate degree and doctoral course work mentioned above for the Bachelor/PhD program. For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

Students will be directed by their advisor to opportunities that are suited for their area of study and as other opportunities become available. For more information please reach out to the Senior Experience Coordinator, Alison Lietzenmayer. ALL students majoring in programs in Communication, Dance, and Theatre must complete a minimum of one three-credit Identity and Inclusion course as part of their curriculum studies to graduate with a degree from the department. This course can either fulfill an applied theories course within a student's area or count as an elective toward their 120-credits needed to earn their degree. Cinema & TV Production students need to complete COMM 271 Introduction to Filmmaking prior to enrollment in any Foundations course, and should not enroll in COMM 269.",

Senior Experiences are designed as stepping stones for students to apply knowledge and skills accrued throughout their coursework toward preparing for future careers. Senior Experience course options will vary by major but include options for an internship, a study abroad/away experience, a service-learning course, a senior capstone, or more specialized experiences within students' chosen majors. Please see descriptions included under each major for more options. Students become eligible for Senior Experience options once they reach 90 credits or with permission of the Senior Experience Coordinator. Students will be directed by their advisor to opportunities that are suited for their area of study and as other opportunities become available. For more information please reach out to the Senior Experience Coordinator, Alison Lietzenmayer. ALL students majoring in programs in Communication, Dance, and Theatre must complete a minimum of one three-credit Identity and Inclusion course as part of their curriculum studies to graduate with a degree from the department. This course can either fulfill an applied theories course within a student's area or count as an elective toward their 120-credits needed to earn their degree. Cinema & TV Production students need to complete COMM 271 Introduction to Filmmaking prior to enrollment in any Foundations course, and should not enroll in COMM 269.",

Senior Experiences are designed as stepping stones for students to apply knowledge and skills accrued throughout their coursework toward preparing for future careers. Senior Experience course options will vary by major but include options for an internship, a study abroad/away experience, a service-learning course, a senior capstone, or more specialized experiences within students' chosen majors. Please see descriptions included under each major for more options. Students become eligible for Senior Experience options once they reach 90 credits or with permission of the Senior Experience Coordinator. Students will be directed by their advisor to opportunities that are suited for their area of study and as other opportunities become available. For more information please reach out to the Senior Experience Coordinator, Alison Lietzenmayer. ALL students majoring in programs in Communication, Dance, and Theatre must complete a minimum of one three-credit Identity and Inclusion course as part of their curriculum studies to graduate with a degree from the department. This course can either fulfill an applied theories course within a student's area or count as an elective toward their 120-credits needed to earn their degree. Cinema & TV Production students need to complete COMM 271 Introduction to Filmmaking prior to enrollment in any Foundations course, and should not enroll in COMM 269.",

Senior Experience course options will vary by major but include options for an internship, a study abroad/away experience, a service-learning course, a senior capstone, or more specialized experiences within students' chosen majors. Please see descriptions included under each major for more options. Students become eligible for Senior Experience options once they reach 90 credits or with permission of the Senior Experience Coordinator. Students will be directed by their advisor to opportunities that are suited for their area of study and as other opportunities become available. For more information please reach out to the Senior Experience Coordinator, Alison Lietzenmayer. ALL students majoring in programs in Communication, Dance, and Theatre must complete a minimum of one three-credit Identity and Inclusion course as part of their curriculum studies to graduate with a degree from the department. This course can either fulfill an applied theories course within a student's area or count as an elective toward their 120-credits needed to earn their degree. Cinema & TV Production students need to complete COMM 271 Introduction to Filmmaking prior to enrollment in any Foundations course, and should not enroll in COMM 269.",

Belfore II, Chief Departmental Advisor The computer engineering undergraduate degree program, available in both synchronous online and face-to-face formats, is designed to provide both a broad engineering background and a comprehensive foundation in the technical principles underlying the computer area. Students develop a background through course work in mathematics, the basic sciences, and general engineering. The technical core consists of course work from electrical engineering to address hardware aspects of computer engineering and course work from computer science to address software aspects. There are two majors available in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree: Computer Engineering major and Modeling & Simulation Engineering major. Adequate elective freedom is available to students in each major. The Computer Engineering major has a built-in minor in computer science, and four technical electives allow for specialization in one or more of four additional areas: computer hardware systems, computer networks, cyber security, or data analytics engineering. The Modeling and Simulation major allows students to select three technical elective courses.  In addition, course work in General Education Skills and Ways of Knowing is required to assure a well-rounded program of study. Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree (BSCE) are intended in their degree until Engineering Fundamental/foundational courses (I.E. Calculus I & II, Calculus-based University Physics I, Programming I, Chemistry I, and Engineering introductory courses) are completed."

The General Education requirements in information literacy and research, impact of technology, and philosophy and ethics are met through the major. The upper-division General Education requirement is met through the completion of a second major/degree. Electrical & Computer engineering majors must earn a grade of C or better in all 200-level ECE courses and all CS courses prior to taking the next course in the sequence. Any ECE course registration issues are to be resolved with the ECE Academic Coordinator and Program Manager. Students must have a 3.00 GPA or better and must obtain approval from their advisor and college dean to register for more than 18 hours in a semester. The four-year plan is a suggested curriculum to complete this degree program in four years.  It is just one of several plans that will work and is presented only as broad guidance to students. Each student is strongly encouraged to develop a customized plan in consultation with their academic advisor.  Additional information can also be found in Degree Works. Students seeking two degrees must complete a minimum of 150 credit hours.",

Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering.

This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience.

To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

A dental hygienist is a licensed professional and member of the oral health care team who provides services to promote optimal oral health. Dental hygienists serve as clinical practitioners, educators, researchers, administrators, managers, program developers, consultants, and/or dental product sales representatives, depending on the individual's employment setting and educational background. In addition, dental hygienists with a bachelor's degree may pursue careers in elementary and secondary schools, community and public health settings, institutional, entrepreneurial and industrial dental hygiene, professional education, and research. Students in good academic standing during the last semester of the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene entry-level program may be approved by the School Chair to take the National Board Examination for Dental Hygiene and a regional licensing board examination. A successful outcome on both examinations is required to practice dental hygiene. The School of Dental Hygiene reserves the right to require remedial work of any student who does not perform at a level satisfactory for patient care. Annually, students are required to submit documentation of a current background check, CPR certification, immunizations and diagnostic procedures. Students are required to complete the School of Dental Hygiene Entrance Health Form and strongly advised to be up to date on all appropriate immunizations to minimize risk of infectious disease due to the nature of clinical care as part of the dental hygiene curriculum.  The University maintains liability insurance on the students while enrolled in the School of Dental Hygiene."

Belfore II, Chief Departmental Advisor The electrical engineering undergraduate curriculum begins with a solid foundation in math, science, English, circuits, signals and linear systems, electronics, electromagnetics, digital systems, and microelectronics. Adequate elective freedom is available to the student to allow specialization in one or more of five areas: systems and automation engineering, physical electronics, computer hardware systems, power and renewable energy, or data analytics engineering.  Emphasis is placed on understanding principles through theoretical investigation and experimental verification. In addition, course work in General Education Skills and Ways of Knowing is required to assure a well-rounded program of study. Students pursuing a BSEE degree are intended in their degree until Engineering Fundamental/foundational courses (I.E. Calculus I & II, Calculus-based University Physics I, Programming I, Chemistry I, and Engineering introductory courses) are completed."

The General Education requirements in information literacy and research, impact of technology, and philosophy and ethics are met through the major. The upper-division General Education requirement is met through a built-in minor in computer science and through the completion of a second major/degree. Electrical & Computer engineering majors must earn a grade of C or better in all 200-level ECE courses and all CS courses prior to taking the next course in the sequence. Any ECE course registration issues are to be resolved with the ECE Academic Coordinator and Program Manager. Students must have a 3.00 GPA or better and must obtain approval from their advisor and college dean to register for more than 18 hours in a semester. The five-year plan is a suggested curriculum to complete this degree program in five years.  It is just one of several plans that will work and is presented only as broad guidance to students. Each student is strongly encouraged to develop a customized plan in consultation with their academic advisor.  Additional information can also be found in Degree Works. Students seeking two degrees must complete a minimum of 150 credit hours.",

ENMA 480 satisfies the PHYS Philosophy & Ethics requirement in the Physics curriculum. The General Education requirements in information literacy and research, impact of technology, and philosophy and ethics are met through the Electrical Engineering major/degree.  The upper-division General Education requirement is met through the completion of a second major/degree. Electrical engineering majors must earn a grade of C or better in all 200-level ECE courses prior to taking the next course in the sequence. Any ECE course registration issues are to be resolved with the ECE Academic Coordinator and Program Manager. The five-year plan is a suggested curriculum to complete this degree program in five years.  It is just one of several plans that will work and is presented only as broad guidance to students. Each student is strongly encouraged to develop a customized plan in consultation with their academic advisor.  Additional information can also be found in Degree Works.",

An eligible student can choose a master's program in the same discipline as his/her bachelor's program or in a complementary discipline. Subject to the approval of the undergraduate and graduate program directors, a student enrolled in a linked program can count up to six credit hours of course work towards both the undergraduate and the graduate degrees. Full-time students may be able to complete the requirements for the bachelor's degree in four years and the master's degree in one additional year.  Students in linked programs must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering.

For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering.

Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering. Continuance in a linked bachelor's/master's program requires maintenance of a GPA of 3.00 or higher overall and in the major."

A select number of exceptionally well-qualified students can be admitted to the Bachelor/PhD program in their junior year while they are pursuing one of the undergraduate programs at Old Dominion University. This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. Just as in the linked Bachelor/MS program, six credit hours of graduate course work may again be counted towards the undergraduate degree and doctoral course work mentioned above for the Bachelor/PhD program. For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

An eligible student can choose a master's program in the same discipline as his/her bachelor's program or in a complementary discipline. Subject to the approval of the undergraduate and graduate program directors, a student enrolled in a linked program can count up to six credit hours of course work towards both the undergraduate and the graduate degrees. Full-time students may be able to complete the requirements for the bachelor's degree in four years and the master's degree in one additional year.  Students in linked programs must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering. Continuance in a linked bachelor's/master's program requires maintenance of a GPA of 3.00 or higher overall and in the major."

A select number of exceptionally well-qualified students can be admitted to the Bachelor/PhD program in their junior year while they are pursuing one of the undergraduate programs at Old Dominion University. This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. Just as in the linked Bachelor/MS program, six credit hours of graduate course work may again be counted towards the undergraduate degree and doctoral course work mentioned above for the Bachelor/PhD program. For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

Subject to the approval of the undergraduate and graduate program directors, a student enrolled in a linked program can count up to six credit hours of course work towards both the undergraduate and the graduate degrees. Full-time students may be able to complete the requirements for the bachelor's degree in four years and the master's degree in one additional year.  Students in linked programs must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering. Continuance in a linked bachelor's/master's program requires maintenance of a GPA of 3.00 or higher overall and in the major."

A select number of exceptionally well-qualified students can be admitted to the Bachelor/PhD program in their junior year while they are pursuing one of the undergraduate programs at Old Dominion University. This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. Just as in the linked Bachelor/MS program, six credit hours of graduate course work may again be counted towards the undergraduate degree and doctoral course work mentioned above for the Bachelor/PhD program. For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

Students learn to embrace uncertainty, overcome challenges, create value, and develop an entrepreneurial mindset to make a difference in the world and in the marketplace. Courses give students the information, abilities, and entrepreneurial spirit necessary to start their own businesses, take on leadership roles in already-existing enterprises, manage small and family-owned firms, and approach difficult problems with new perspectives, making them more equipped to handle the demands of the modern economy, which is fast-paced and unpredictable, and where success is determined by the ability to see opportunities, innovate, and move quickly to market. The interdisciplinary minor requires 12 credit hours of 300/400-level courses selected from at least two different disciplines with a maximum of six credits from any one discipline. For completion of the interdisciplinary minor, students must have a minimum overall cumulative grade point average of 2.00 in all courses specified as a requirement for the minor exclusive of lower-level courses and prerequisite courses. At least six hours of upper-level courses must be taken through courses offered by Old Dominion University.

The curriculum in environmental health, which is accredited by the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council, encompasses a variety of disciplines in the preparation of environmental health professionals, industrial hygienists, and occupational safety and health specialists. Environmental health professionals manage environmental health and safety programs, work with communities to address environmental hazards, conduct environmental hazard and accident investigations, provide safety training, conduct safety audits, perform Job Hazard Analysis, work to foster sustainability, and lead emergency preparedness and response services. Industrial hygienists conduct evaluations and monitor harmful agents and health hazards (such as: noise and vibration, chemicals, gases and vapors, radiation, heat, and biohazards) in the work environment and recommend controls to minimize the health risk to workers in the occupational environment. In simple terms they anticipate, recognize, evaluate and control occupational exposures. On the environmental side, environmental health professionals engage in education, consultation, and enforcement relating to local, state and federal environmental health laws, regulations, and standards. They work on air and water quality, food safety, management of hazardous and infectious materials, housing, disease vectors, institutional environments, and other environmental health issues.  Environmental health professionals manage environmental health and safety programs for companies, government agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, health departments, and military installations. The program requires three credit hours of internship field practice within an environmental or occupational health facility or industrial site.  A variety of internship sites are available in the Hampton Roads area for these experiences. Internship sites throughout the U.S. and overseas are also available. Internships are available any semester but are typically completed in the summer between the junior and senior year.  Most internships are paid and many out of area internships offer a stipend to cover expenses. Upon graduation, students are eligible to sit for the professional licensing examination in environmental health.  With work experience, students are eligible to take the certification examinations in industrial hygiene as Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) and/or in safety as Associate Safety Professional (ASP) and then a Certified Safety Professional (CSP). A broad spectrum of employment opportunities are available to graduates.  Alumni employment success has been outstanding, with graduates finding employment in agencies such as the USDA, EPA, OSHA, NASA, FDA, and DOD. Many work in private industries, manufacturing plants, the oil industry, consulting firms, health departments, waste and wastewater plants, civil service, and other organizations."

Candidates for admission to the BSBA program should indicate on the application to the University their intention to enter the undergraduate business administration degree program. Admission to the BSBA degree program is a two-step process. Students must first successfully complete Step 1 Admission requirements (described below), and be certified as having done so, before undertaking the requirements for Step 2 Admission to the BSBA degree program (described below). All candidates for admission to the undergraduate business administration program should contact the Strome College of Business directly for an Application for Step 1 Admission or an Application for Step 2 Admission to the program. Applications are available on the Strome College of Business's website, in all of its department offices, and in the College's Undergraduate Advising office. Normally, students should apply for Step 1 Admission in their sophomore year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 1 Admission decision. Students should normally apply for Step 2 Admission in their junior year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 2 Admission decision. Students will remain \"Intended\" business majors until their Step 2 application has been approved."

The core graphic design curriculum stresses essential competencies in conceptual problem solving, research, analysis and articulation, aesthetics, design theory, productivity, and the application of technology, necessary for both advanced exploration and entry into professional practice. All graphic design students can expect a creative and collaborative environment built upon the experience of a faculty of practicing designers and design educators. Limited enrollment and class sizes ensure an intense and individualized course of study leading to a competitive portfolio for entry into the profession. The department's dedicated state-of-the-art facilities include classroom and production spaces built and equipped to facilitate instruction and invention with traditional and digital media. The program strongly encourages and supports critical interaction with the design community through internships, professional memberships, and participation in design competitions."

Students begin their studies with a thorough grounding in the skills required to successfully engage the traditions and contemporary practices of painting and drawing. Initial coursework provides students strong technical, perceptual and visualization skills through a comprehensive and rigorous Foundations and Studio Core curriculum, gaining material handling competencies of both painting and drawing media. Intermediate coursework includes a review and expansion of these competencies with exploration into the expressive potential of painting and drawing through thematically-driven projects. Advanced coursework provides students the tools to develop individual bodies of work exploring individualized preferred concepts, subject matter, techniques, and media. Painting and Drawing students are recognized as artists and are treated as such; their individual voices are vital to the learning experience cultivated within the program. Painting and Drawing students generate artworks that position them for success in today’s competitive market. At the conclusion of their studies, painting and drawing students are capable of creating works of personal pursuit that display an understanding of the historical and contemporary contexts of art making. Additionally, students will have obtained a high level of technical facility, knowledge of professional practice standards, as well as an appreciation for the limitless possibilities of their creativity and the multitude of tools at their disposal."

Transferable course requirements pertaining to licensure that come from the Darden College of Education and Professional Studies professional education coursework must be approved through the Darden College of Education and Professional Studies if they do not meet the already pre-approved transferable courses. For a minor in either art history, studio arts or studio art photography, transfer students must complete two elective courses in art history at the 300/400 level at Old Dominion University. Before registering for classes, transfer students who enroll in the BFA (all majors) or the BA in visual studies must submit a portfolio of work for review by the Art Department chief departmental advisor who will determine which transferable courses will meet equivalent requirements in the major.  Transfer students for the BFA with majors in art education must also be approved by the art education program director who will determine which transferable art education and professional courses will meet equivalent requirements in the major and those that must still be completed for licensure. Appointments for transfer portfolio evaluations must be made prior to registration for classes."

Each student will develop an individual program of courses that meets their interests. In photography, students will gain a broad understanding of contemporary photography and its applications in today’s world. From digital to analog, students will become well versed in technique as well as contemporary theory. Classes focus on darkroom, digital editing and studio lighting along with learning how to develop their own unique voice as a photographer and artist. In print media, students have the opportunity to learn a wide range of print techniques and strategies. Every major image reproduction technology, from woodblock printing to large-format inkjet prints, is available to students. Print technique, history, and theory are brought together in guiding students’ creative work and artistic development. Classes take place in the department's brand-new art building equipped with a state-of-the-art computer lab dedicated to photo students and supplied with the latest software. In addition, the photo area contains a darkroom, lighting studio, advanced print lab and general workroom. The print area is equipped for letterpress, screenprint, lithography, relief, and intaglio printmaking, in addition to a digital print lab. At the end of the program students will take a yearlong seminar dedicated to developing a provocative senior project that will culminate in the senior exhibition at the Baron and Ellin Gordon Art Galleries."

              "paragraph": "The linked BA/MPA or BS/MPA program provides qualified Old Dominion University undergraduate students with the opportunity to earn a master's degree in public administration while taking credits in the MPA program as an undergraduate student.  The program is designed for highly motivated students with the desire to immediately continue their education after the bachelor's degree.  The program is especially relevant to individuals seeking to work (or currently working) in the public or non-profit sectors, but is suitable for students from any undergraduate major.  Graduate courses may be taken during the fall and spring semester of the student's senior undergraduate year.  Up to 12 graduate credits can count toward both the undergraduate and graduate degree and can meet upper-level General Education requirements. After receiving the undergraduate degree, a student will continue with the MPA program, taking MPA courses until completing the required 39 credit hours. Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

These nine credit-hour concentrations allow students to meet all MBA graduation requirements while adding a credential to their MBA degree in a particular area of focus. Students pursuing a concentration will complete a prescribed set of MBA Depth and Elective courses as outlined in the MBA concentrations tables provided in the MBA section of the Graduate Catalog. Alternatively, students may choose to enhance their learning experience by adding a graduate certificate from those offered at Old Dominion University. Many of the available MBA concentrations listed are comprised of coursework required for an associated graduate certificate.  Graduate certificates require a minimum of 12 to a maximum of 24 credit depending upon the certificate and its learning objectives. Please note that a maximum of 12 credit hours of work at the 500-level can be applied toward the MBA program of study."

A philosophy course designated with a P will not meet this requirement for business administration students with the exception of a \"P\" course taken prior to fall 2010. Impact of Technology requirement is satisfied within each BSBA degree major except Information Systems and Technology by IT 360T. In the Information Systems and Technology majors (excluding Business Analytics), the Impact of Technology requirement is satisfied by the coursework required for the major. Transfer students with an applicable associate's degree from a Virginia Community College or another community college that has a seamless transfer agreement with ODU, and students with a prior bachelor's degree from another university, must nevertheless have a grade of C or better in the following to be able to transfer them:",

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

This major provides students with a broad overview of how to work within and manage companies, non-profits, and other teams. Recognizing that most graduates will face several career changes and job choices, the management major prepares students for success in a global economy by enhancing understanding about human behavior at work (organizational behavior), best practices and policies for managing people (human resource management), cultural differences and economic differences across countries (international business), and how top-level strategic decisions impact organizations (business policy and strategy). A variety of management major elective options give students an opportunity to pursue their interests and focus in areas such as Human Resource Management, General Management, International Business, and/or Entrepreneurship. For the major in management, all courses must be preceded by listed prerequisites. Students must earn a grade of C- or better in all required Management Major courses and Management Elective courses. To graduate, students will need at least a 2.0 GPA for their Management Major.

Admission to the University does not guarantee admission to the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) program. Candidates for admission to the BSBA program should indicate on the application to the University their intention to enter the undergraduate business administration degree program. Admission to the BSBA degree program is a two-step process. Students must first successfully complete Step 1 Admission requirements (described below), and be certified as having done so, before undertaking the requirements for Step 2 Admission to the BSBA degree program (described below). All candidates for admission to the undergraduate business administration program should contact the Strome College of Business directly for an Application for Step 1 Admission or an Application for Step 2 Admission to the program. Applications are available on the Strome College of Business's website, in all of its department offices, and in the College's Undergraduate Advising office. Normally, students should apply for Step 1 Admission in their sophomore year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 1 Admission decision. Students should normally apply for Step 2 Admission in their junior year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 2 Admission decision. Students will remain \"Intended\" business majors until their Step 2 application has been approved."

Candidates for admission to the BSBA program should indicate on the application to the University their intention to enter the undergraduate business administration degree program. Admission to the BSBA degree program is a two-step process. Students must first successfully complete Step 1 Admission requirements (described below), and be certified as having done so, before undertaking the requirements for Step 2 Admission to the BSBA degree program (described below). All candidates for admission to the undergraduate business administration program should contact the Strome College of Business directly for an Application for Step 1 Admission or an Application for Step 2 Admission to the program. Applications are available on the Strome College of Business's website, in all of its department offices, and in the College's Undergraduate Advising office. Normally, students should apply for Step 1 Admission in their sophomore year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 1 Admission decision. Students should normally apply for Step 2 Admission in their junior year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 2 Admission decision. Students will remain \"Intended\" business majors until their Step 2 application has been approved."

The major areas are: accounting, business analytics, economics, enterprise cybersecurity, finance, human resource management, international business, information systems and technology, management, marketing, personal financial planning, real estate, and risk management and insurance. To stay in compliance with AACSB accreditation standards, students receiving a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Old Dominion University must complete at least half of their business course work in residence with a minimum of four courses in their declared major. This equates to 10 business classes, thus meeting the University's residency requirement as well. Majors in the college may not take business and public administration courses for pass/fail credit except those courses in which pass/fail is the only grading option (i.e., internships and practica). No more than four hours of activity credit (used as free electives) may be applied to degree requirements for students majoring within the college."

Students must first successfully complete Step 1 Admission requirements (described below), and be certified as having done so, before undertaking the requirements for Step 2 Admission to the BSBA degree program (described below). All candidates for admission to the undergraduate business administration program should contact the Strome College of Business directly for an Application for Step 1 Admission or an Application for Step 2 Admission to the program. Applications are available on the Strome College of Business's website, in all of its department offices, and in the College's Undergraduate Advising office. Normally, students should apply for Step 1 Admission in their sophomore year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 1 Admission decision. Students should normally apply for Step 2 Admission in their junior year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 2 Admission decision.

It builds valuable relationships for companies and makes them more competitive in the marketplace. The marketing management degree program teaches students marketing, communication, and analytical knowledge and prepares students for high-demand marketing career opportunities in today's and tomorrow's global environment. The marketing management degree program offers a general marketing major and three distinctive career-oriented majors: For completion of a major under marketing management, a student must have a minimum overall cumulative grade point average of 2.00 in all courses taken toward the major. In addition, a grade of C- or better is required in all marketing courses counted toward the major. A student who seeks a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree in one of the marketing management majors from Old Dominion University must, in addition to meeting other requirements of the University, earn a minimum of 25 percent of the total number of credits required for the degree (for example, 30 credits in a 120-credit degree program) through on- or off-campus instruction. This must include a minimum of 12 credit hours of upper-level MKTG courses."

Applications are available on the Strome College of Business's website, in all of its department offices, and in the College's Undergraduate Advising office. Normally, students should apply for Step 1 Admission in their sophomore year. The Strome College of Business will notify students of the Step 1 Admission decision.

An eligible student can choose a master's program in the same discipline as his/her bachelor's program or in a complementary discipline. Subject to the approval of the undergraduate and graduate program directors, a student enrolled in a linked program can count up to six credit hours of course work towards both the undergraduate and the graduate degrees. Full-time students may be able to complete the requirements for the bachelor's degree in four years and the master's degree in one additional year.  Students in linked programs must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students who are matriculated in an undergraduate major in the Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology with a GPA of at least 3.00 overall and 3.00 in the major are eligible to apply for admission to a linked bachelor's/master's program. Transfer students who desire to be admitted to a linked program at the time they join an undergraduate major at Old Dominion University are eligible to apply if their overall GPA at their previous institution is 3.25 or higher. Prerequisite courses may be required for engineering technology majors to pursue a master's degree in engineering. Continuance in a linked bachelor's/master's program requires maintenance of a GPA of 3.00 or higher overall and in the major."

A select number of exceptionally well-qualified students can be admitted to the Bachelor/PhD program in their junior year while they are pursuing one of the undergraduate programs at Old Dominion University. This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. Just as in the linked Bachelor/MS program, six credit hours of graduate course work may again be counted towards the undergraduate degree and doctoral course work mentioned above for the Bachelor/PhD program. For linked bachelor's to doctoral programs, students must earn a minimum of 198 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 78 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Students in these programs must maintain a GPA of 3.50 or better throughout their bachelor's and doctoral studies. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate. To obtain the master's degree, the student must utilize the six graduate credits obtained as part of their undergraduate program, use 18 credits of the graduate course work that is part of the PhD, and work with the Graduate Program Director to plan the final 6 credits."

The program offers a first and second degree option as well as a post-baccalaureate certificate option. Cytologists are specially trained medical laboratory professionals who work with pathologists in detecting changes in cell samples from numerous body sites which allows the early diagnosis of cancer. This is done primarily with the use of the microscope to evaluate slide preparation of cell samples for abnormalities in structure, indicating cancer, precancerous lesions, benign tumors, infectious agents and inflammatory processes. They are also trained in specimen preparation, molecular, FISH, flow cytometry techniques, and fine needle aspiration cytology. The program of study is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP), 9355 113th Street, N.W. Seminole, FL. 33775; phone: 727-210-2350; e-mail: mail@caahep.org; website: www.caahep.org, in association with the American Society of Cytopathology (ASC). Theory is reinforced through an integrated clinical phase that allows the student direct experience in a hospital or lab setting providing additional training in screening techniques and diagnostic procedures.  Students are required to obtain a minimum grade of 70 percent or C in all didactic coursework.  Clinical coursework requires a minimum passing grade of 80, 85 and 90 percent during the first, second and third internship, respectively.  Graduates are eligible to sit for the national board exam given by the ASCP (American Society of Clinical Pathology) upon successful completion of the program. Application to the cytology program must be submitted by May 1.  Competitive applicants should have an overall GPA of 2.8 or higher."

Audit status is normally allowed for one semester only and is granted on the auditioning committee's recommendation that the student will likely be ready for credit study after one semester of audit study. A student with audit status will audition for credit study during the jury examination period at the close of the audit semester.",

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree).

              "paragraph": "The linked BA/MPA or BS/MPA program provides qualified Old Dominion University undergraduate students with the opportunity to earn a master's degree in public administration while taking credits in the MPA program as an undergraduate student.  The program is designed for highly motivated students with the desire to immediately continue their education after the bachelor's degree.  The program is especially relevant to individuals seeking to work (or currently working) in the public or non-profit sectors, but is suitable for students from any undergraduate major.  Graduate courses may be taken during the fall and spring semester of the student's senior undergraduate year.  Up to 12 graduate credits can count toward both the undergraduate and graduate degree and can meet upper-level General Education requirements. After receiving the undergraduate degree, a student will continue with the MPA program, taking MPA courses until completing the required 39 credit hours. Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students who are enrolled in an AAS/ADN program typically take 1-2 ODU RN-BSN courses each semester in addition to their courses. As part of ODUGlobal, the ODU nursing courses are offered in an on-line program of study. The concurrent scheduling option is for students who have completed all lower-division departmental and general education courses for the BSN and are enrolled in an RN program at a partner institution.  Advisors work with students to develop an individual plan of study to fulfill the requirements. Following graduation from the AAS/ADN program and successful completion of the NCLEX RN licensure exam, the student will be awarded 33 nursing transfer credits toward completion of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. Fall, Spring and Summer enrollment is available. The Concurrent Enrollment option contributes to the BSN prepared workforce as well as prepares RNs for graduate programs by creating a seamless progression from the AAS to the BSN. Graduates of the baccalaureate program in professional nursing are generalists prepared to care for culturally diverse individuals and groups across the lifespan in a complex global community. Upon completion of the innovative, technology-enhanced program, graduates are knowledgeable about current trends in health care, assume responsibility for their professional growth, and are prepared for graduate study in nursing. The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and approved by the Virginia State Board of Nursing. The BSN is awarded upon successful completion of the following:\n1. The Associate Degree in Nursing program\n2. Passing NCLEX\n3. Completion of BSN coursework"

Because of the dynamic nature of the nursing profession, currency of both nursing content and clinical skills is essential. Patient safety is of critical concern and is compromised when a student has out-of-date knowledge and/or less than competent nursing care skills. Transfer of nursing credits into the BSN curriculum may be affected if there has been a lapse of time greater than one year since previous nursing enrollment or by availability of clinical placements."

As part of ODUGlobal, courses are offered in an on-line program of study. Graduates of the baccalaureate program in professional nursing are generalists prepared to care for culturally diverse individuals and groups across the lifespan in a complex global community. Upon completion of the innovative, technology-enhanced program, graduates are knowledgeable about current trends in health care, assume responsibility for their professional growth, and are prepared for graduate study in nursing.

Because of the dynamic nature of the nursing profession, currency of both nursing content and clinical skills is essential. Patient safety is of critical concern and is compromised when a student has out-of-date knowledge and/or less than competent nursing care skills.

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Candidates will be provided a field experience placement when the background check process is completed with resolution of any issues. The process to complete the ODU clearance background check is located at: https://ww1.odu.edu/oce/placement/background-checks.  The ODU clearance process includes:  an FBI fingerprint SP-24 form, a child protective service/social service review, and a Virginia State Police sex offender registry review. Candidates interested in the professional education programs are advised to complete this clearance process immediately upon entry into the program since the clearance process takes a minimum of eight weeks to complete."

Does not include the University's General Education language and culture requirement. Additional hours may be required. ENGN 121 satisfies both the Physics Approved Seminar requirement and the PHYS Information Literacy and Research requirement in the Physics curriculum. ECE 287 satisfies the PHYS 303 requirement in the Physics curriculum. PHYS 425 satisfies the Nonmajor Engineering Elective requirement in the Electrical Engineering curriculum. PHYS 453 and PHYS 456 offered spring semester only. Electrical Engineering students need four technical elective courses selected from one of two options: (1) four 400-level ECE technical elective courses; (2) three 400-level ECE technical elective courses and one 300-level ECE technical elective course or one approved 300- or 400-level CS/MATH/Engineering course. ENMA 480 satisfies the PHYS Philosophy & Ethics requirement in the Physics curriculum. The General Education requirements in information literacy and research, impact of technology, and philosophy and ethics are met through the Electrical Engineering major/degree.  The upper-division General Education requirement is met through the completion of a second major/degree. Electrical engineering majors must earn a grade of C or better in all 200-level ECE courses prior to taking the next course in the sequence.

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Brown Graduates of the Public Health major will possess knowledge and skills necessary to prevent disease, prolong life, and promote health. Graduates will also have the skills to be leaders in their community where they can showcase their ability to describe data related to social determinants of health, determine interventions needed for various communities, and demonstrate the ability to collect, manage, and analyze data. Graduates will be able to serve as leaders in the various capacities at the local, state, or federal level. Students will have skills valuable to health departments, non-profit organizations, hospitals, and even the military. Graduates may consider furthering their education with a Master of Public Health while others may pursue clinical programs (e.g., medicine, nursing, or physician assistant), occupational therapy, physical therapy, dental hygiene, etc. The curriculum for the Public Health major incorporates rigorous coursework in epidemiology and biostatistics, social and behavioral aspects of health, the United states healthcare delivery system, healthcare ethics, the natural sciences, health policy, and environmental health issues, among other areas. The program also provides students with courses in basic research methods necessary for assessment, analysis, communication, research, problem solving, and critical thinking abilities in the emerging emphasis on evidence-based health care and public health. Students will have the opportunity to gain practical public health exposure and mentoring in clinical, research, or community settings. The Public Health major is available in a hybrid format with some courses offered online and some in person. The program can also be completed fully online to increase flexibility for students."

The internship is a planned, supervised, and evaluated 200-hour experience under the direction of the internship coordinator. (Note: Students enrolled in the linked BSPH to MPH program are required to perform 120 hours as those students take graduate-level courses and are required to complete an Applied Practice Experience/practicum in the graduate program.) The policies, guidelines, and processes followed by the coordinator and students are delineated in the Internship Manual provided to students when they enroll in the program. The internship provides the opportunity for students to integrate their academic work into experiential learning to gain additional experience in the field or community of the student's choice. The experience will allow a student to gain basic job entry or advanced skills by working with experienced public health or healthcare professionals in a public or private organization. Students may select the internship site, or they may seek guidance from faculty about possible sites. Students may be eligible for internship upon senior standing in the major (at least 90 credits) and completion of all required prerequisites. Senior standing is imperative for success in the internship course as the foundational skills and concepts are achieved during the span of entire coursework at ODU. Internships must be sought and undertaken in an organization, agency, department, or community that provides planning and/or services that are relevant to the core areas of public health. Any student who plans to organize an internship without the appropriate foundation may be at a disadvantage in the organizations in which internships are undertaken. All public health students will complete an internship related to public health. The internship experience and corresponding internship course both address the relevance of developing skills and competencies as required for the future of public health practitioners. As part of the course assessment, students are required to develop an electronic portfolio (ePortfolio). The ePortfolio is a collection of work completed by the student during the internship and can be used to present the student’s “professional” or digital self to others. In addition to submitting an ePortfolio, students must submit a comprehensive attendance record that covers the entire internship period. Students who have five or more years of supervisory or management experience in a public health field can apply for a Prior Learning ePortfolio Challenge, which could replace the internship course.  A cover letter and resume will be required for initial review. Please contact the BSPH internship coordinator to discuss this option. Some internship sites may require the student to complete a criminal background check, drug screening, computer-based training, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) training, proof of vaccination status, and/or other relevant responsibilities needed to train in public health organizations prior to beginning the internship.

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Additionally, passing scores on the Special Education exit exam and the Virginia Communication and Literacy Assessment (VCLA) are required prerequisites to enrollment in SPED 486.  Special Education exit examination scores will be submitted to the Office of Clinical Experiences by the Undergraduate Program Director; however, students must submit copies of VCLA results to both the Office of Clinical Experiences and the Undergraduate Program Director.  All teacher candidates must consult with an academic advisor every semester to review their academic progress.",

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Classes also introduce students to clinical procedures for assessment and treatment of communication and swallowing disorders. The minimum number of hours required for the degree is 120 credits. The bachelor's-level students are not eligible for employment as a licensed speech-language pathologist or audiologist in any professional setting. Therefore, the undergraduate program at Old Dominion University serves as a feeder program for students to apply to the graduate program in speech-language pathology where licensure and certification standards will be met. The undergraduate program at Old Dominion University provides students with the coursework required to apply for national certification as a Speech-Language Pathology Assistant. Finally, the undergraduate degree also prepares students to apply to graduate audiology programs that are offered at other universities and other professional graduate programs."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."

Students in the linked program must earn a minimum of 150 credit hours (120 discrete credit hours for the undergraduate degree and 30 discrete credit hours for the graduate degree). Requirements for admission to the graduate program can be found in the School of Public Service section of the Graduate Catalog.  For additional information, please contact the School of Public Service in the Strome College of Business."
